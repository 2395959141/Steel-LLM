I need to find the length PQ, which is the distance between the points where the inscribed circles of triangles BEF and DEF are tangent to EF. Hmm... first, let me visualize the rectangle ABCD. AB is 63 units, and BC is 448 units. So, the rectangle has AB and CD as the shorter sides (length 63) and BC and AD as the longer sides (length 448). \\n\\nPoints E and F are on AD and BC respectively, with AE = CF = 84. So, starting from A, moving along AD, we mark point E such that AE = 84. Since AD is 448, ED must be 448 - 84 = 364. Similarly, starting from C, moving along BC (which is also 448 units), CF is 84, so FB would be 448 - 84 = 364. Got that.\\n\\nNow, there are triangles BEF and DEF. Both of these triangles have EF as one of their sides. The inscribed circle (incircle) of each triangle is tangent to EF at points P and Q respectively. I need to find PQ, the distance between these two points.\\n\\nFirst, let me recall that the incircle of a triangle touches each side at exactly one point, and the points of tangency divide the sides into segments whose lengths are related to the triangle's semiperimeter. Specifically, the distance from a vertex to the point of tangency on the adjacent side is equal to (semiperimeter - length of opposite side). Maybe I can use this property to find the location of P and Q on EF.\\n\\nSo, for triangle BEF, the incircle touches EF at P. Similarly, for triangle DEF, the incircle touches EF at Q. If I can find where P and Q are located along EF, then computing PQ would be straightforward.\\n\\nTo do that, first perhaps determine the coordinates of points E, F, B, D, etc. Then, calculate the required semiperimeters for triangles BEF and DEF, apply that formula to find the distances from the vertices to the tangency points, and figure out where P and Q lie on EF.\\n\\nLet me start by setting up a coordinate system. Let's place rectangle ABCD with point A at the origin (0,0). So, AB is horizontal, right? Since AB=63, point B is at (63,0). BC is vertical upwards, length 448, so point C is at (63,448). Then AD is vertical upwards from A (0,0) to D (0,448). Is that correct? Wait, actually rectangles can be oriented in different ways. Wait, hold on, ABCD is a rectangle. The sides AB, BC, CD, DA should each be consecutive. So, if AB is 63 and BC is 448, then AB and CD are of length 63, BC and AD are of length 448. That makes ABCD a rectangle where AB and CD are the horizontal sides of length 63, and BC and AD are the vertical sides of length 448. Wait, but in a rectangle, opposite sides are equal. So, AB=CD=63 and BC=AD=448. Thus, the rectangle is 63 units wide and 448 units tall.\\n\\nTherefore, positioning the rectangle with A at (0,0), then moving right to B (63,0), up to C (63,448), left to D (0,448), and back to A. That makes AD the left side from (0,0) to (0,448), BC is the right side from (63,0) to (63,448).\\n\\nPoints E and F lie on AD and BC respectively. AE=CF=84, so E is on AD 84 units from A. Since AD is from (0,0) to (0,448), going upward, E will be at (0,84). Similarly, CF =84 means F is on BC 84 units from C. Since BC goes from (63,448) down to (63,0), moving down 84 units from C brings us to (63, 448 -84) = (63, 364). So point F is at (63,364).\\n\\nPoints E: (0,84), F: (63,364).\\n\\nNow, the triangles in question are BEF and DEF.\\n\\nFirst, let's clarify the coordinates:\\n\\n- B is (63,0)\\n- E is (0,84)\\n- F is (63,364)\\n- D is (0,448)\\n\\nLet's also include coordinates for completeness.\\n\\nSo triangle BEF consists of points B(63,0), E(0,84), F(63,364). Triangle DEF consists of points D(0,448), E(0,84), F(63,364).\\n\\nNow, for both triangles, EF is the common side. EF connects E(0,84) and F(63,364). So, let's first compute the length of EF.\\n\\nThe coordinates of E and F are (0,84) and (63,364). The distance EF is sqrt((63-0)^2 + (364 -84)^2). Calculating that: horizontal distance 63, vertical distance 364-84=280.\\n\\nSo, sqrt(63² + 280²). 63 squared is 3969, 280 squared is 78400. Sum is 3969 + 78400 = 82369. The square root of 82369 is... Hmm, let's see. 280² is 78400, so 280² + 63². I think 287 = sqrt(82369) check: 287² = (280 +7)^2 = 280² + 2*280*7 +7² =78400 +3920 +49=78400+3920=82320 +49=82369. Yeah, sqrt of 82369 is 287. So EF is 287 units long.\\n\\nCool. So length EF = 287.\\n\\nIncircle of triangle BEF is tangent to EF at P, and incircle of triangle DEF is tangent to EF at Q. The distance PQ is to be found. Since EF is a straight line of 287 units, once we can find the positions of P and Q along it (e.g., as distances from E or F), PQ would be |position_P - position_Q|.\\n\\nSo, maybe first, find the point of tangency P on EF for triangle BEF. The formula for the tangency point on a side is related to the semiperimeter.\\n\\nIn a triangle, for each side, the tangency point splits the side into two segments. The distance from each vertex to the tangency point is equal to the semiperimeter minus the length of the opposite side.\\n\\nSo, for triangle BEF, the side EF has tangency point P. Let's compute the semiperimeter (s) of triangle BEF.\\n\\nFirst, let me compute the lengths of all sides of triangle BEF:\\n\\nWe already computed EF as 287.\\n\\nThen, other sides:\\n\\nBE: distance between B(63,0) and E(0,84). Horizontal distance: 63-0=63. Vertical distance:84-0=84. So sqrt(63² +84²). 63 and 84, 63 is 3*21, 84 is 4*21, so sqrt( (3² +4²)*21² ) = sqrt(25*21²)=5*21=105. So BE=105 units.\\n\\nBF: distance between B(63,0) and F(63,364). Vertical distance, since they share x-coordinate. That's 364-0=364. So BF=364 units.\\n\\nThus, triangle BEF has sides BE=105, EF=287, BF=364.\\n\\nSemiperimeter (s) is (105 +287 +364)/2 = sum is 105+287=392+364=756. s=756/2=378.\\n\\nNow according to the tangency point formula, the distance from vertex B to tangency point on EF (which is P) would be s - opposite side. Wait, actually, the formula is for each tangency point on a side, the distance from the two adjacent vertices.\\n\\nIn general, on side EF of triangle BEF, the tangency point P divides EF into two segments: from E to P and from P to F. Each of the distances from E to P and F to P would be (s - opposite side). That is, EP = s - BF, and FP = s - BE.\\n\\nWait, yes. Let me confirm. In triangle, the distance from the vertex to the tangency point on the adjacent side is equal to (semiperimeter minus the length of the opposite side). For the incircle.\\n\\nWait: For a triangle with sides a, b, c, and semiperimeter s = (a+b+c)/2, then the distance from vertex A to the tangency point on side AB is s - c, where c is the opposite side (BC).\\n\\nSo applying this to triangle BEF. Let me name side BE as a, BF as b, EF as c. Maybe need to be careful here. Alternatively, vertices are B, E, F.\\n\\nFor edge EF, adjacent to E and F. The tangency point P on EF would then split EF into lengths EP and FP, corresponding to s - BF and s - BE. Wait: if edge EF is opposite vertex B, then the tangency point distances from E and F would be s - BF and s - BE respectively.\\n\\nWait, perhaps to think:\\n\\nEach side of the triangle is adjacent to two vertices. So on side EF, adjacent to E and F. The part of EF near E would correspond to the distance from E to P = s - BF, and from F to P = s - BE.\\n\\nSo compute EP = s - BF = 378 - 364 =14\\n\\nSimilarly, FP = s - BE = 378 -105=273.\\n\\nCheck that this adds up to EF: 14 +273=287, which matches. Yep, so EP=14 and FP=273. So point P is 14 units from E and 273 units from F along EF.\\n\\nSimilarly, for triangle DEF's incircle tangency point Q on EF.\\n\\nNeed to compute the semiperimeter of DEF. Let's find the side lengths of DEF.\\n\\nThey are DE, DF, EF.\\n\\nFirst, DE: distance between D(0,448) and E(0,84). That's vertical distance 448-84=364, so DE=364.\\n\\nDF: distance from D(0,448) to F(63,364). Horizontal distance 63-0=63; vertical distance 448 -364=84. So DF is sqrt(63² +84²) similar to BE. Again, sqrt(63² +84²)=same BE which was 105. So DF=105.\\n\\nEF is already known as 287. So triangle DEF has sides DE=364, DF=105, EF=287.\\n\\nSemiperimeter (s) is (364 +105 +287)/2. Sum: 364+105=469, 469 +287=756. s =756/2=378.\\n\\nSame semiperimeter as triangle BEF, interesting! Both triangles have the same semiperimeter?\\n\\nHmm, perhaps coincidental. Let's proceed.\\n\\nFor tangency point Q on EF in triangle DEF. Similarly, in triangle DEF, side EF is adjacent to E and F again. The same method applies: the distances from E and F to Q are s - DF and s - DE respectively.\\n\\nThus, EQ = s - DF = 378 - 105=273\\n\\nFQ = s - DE =378 -364=14\\n\\nThus, EQ=273 and FQ=14. Therefore, Q is 273 units from E and 14 units from F along EF.\\n\\nWait! So for triangle BEF, the tangency point P is 14 units from E and 273 from F. For triangle DEF's tangency point Q is 273 from E and 14 from F. That is, P is near E and Q is near F. So the distance between P and Q would be the length of EF minus (EP + FQ)? Wait, let's consider.\\n\\nSince EF has total length 287. Suppose the positions of P and Q as:\\n\\nP is 14 units from E, so that would be at 14 units from E towards F.\\n\\nQ is 14 units from F, moving towards E. Wait, EQ is 273 units from E, meaning 273 from E towards F but since EF is 287 units, 273 from E is equal to 287 -273=14 from F. So yeah, Q is 14 units from F towards E.\\n\\nSo the locations of P and Q along EF from E:\\n\\nP is at 14, Q is at 273.\\n\\nTherefore, PQ is the distance between those two points on EF: 273 -14=259. Since EF is a straight line, the distance PQ is just 259 units.\\n\\nBut wait, that seems surprisingly straightforward? So PQ would be 273 -14=259? Therefore, 259 is the answer?\\n\\nWait, but EF is distance from E to F. Units from E:\\n\\nP is at 14, Q is at 273. So if traveling from E to F along EF, start at E, go 14 to P, then go another (273 -14)=259 to Q, then go another 14 to reach F.\\n\\nWait, that's a total of 14 +259 +14=287. Correct.\\n\\nHence, PQ is this middle segment, which is 259.\\n\\nTherefore, PQ=259.\\n\\nBut just want to confirm that we didn't make any mistakes here. Let me recheck calculations.\\n\\nIn triangle BEF:\\n\\nSemiperimeter s=378. Tangency point on EF: EP = s - BF = 378 -364=14\\n\\nSimilarly, FP=378 -105=273.\\n\\nIn triangle DEF:\\n\\nSemiperimeter s=378. Tangency point on EF: EQ = s - DF=378 -105=273\\n\\nFQ=378 -364=14\\n\\nTherefore, PQ is distance between P (14) and Q (273) on EF. So PQ=273 -14=259. So 259 should be the answer.\\n\\nBut let me double-check all the steps to ensure no mistakes.\\n\\nFirst, coordinates of the rectangle: A(0,0), B(63,0), C(63,448), D(0,448). Correct.\\n\\nPoints E and F:\\n\\nE is at AE=84, so from A(0,0) upwards on AD (0,448) to (0,84). Correct.\\n\\nCF=84: from C(63,448) down BC (63,0) to (63,364). Correct.\\n\\nCoordinates of E(0,84) and F(63,364). Correct.\\n\\nDistance EF: as computed sqrt(63² +280²)=sqrt(3969 +78400)=sqrt(82369)=287. Correct.\\n\\nSides of triangles BEF and DEF.\\n\\nTriangle BEF:\\n\\nBE: from B(63,0) to E(0,84): sqrt(63² +84²)=sqrt(3969 +7056)=sqrt(11025)=105. Correct.\\n\\nBF: from B(63,0) to F(63,364): vertical distance 364. Correct.\\n\\nEF:287. Sides 105,364,287. Semi perimeter (105+364+287)/2=756/2=378. Correct.\\n\\nDEF triangle:\\n\\nDE: from D(0,448) to E(0,84). 448-84=364. Correct.\\n\\nDF: D(0,448) to F(63,364). sqrt(63² +84²)=105. Correct.\\n\\nEF:287. So sides 364,105,287. Semi perimeter same as BEF: 378. Correct.\\n\\nApplication of formula for distances: from vertex through semi perimeter minus opposite side.\\n\\nFor BEF on EF: EP=s - BF=378 -364=14. FP=378 -105=273. Correct.\\n\\nFor DEF on EF: EQ=s - DF=273, FQ=14. Correct.\\n\\nEF length is287. EP+FP=14+273=287, EQ+FQ=273+14=287. Checked. So okay.\\n\\nThus, PQ, is the combined middle segment of EF where P is 14 from E, and Q is273 from E. So PQ=273-14=259. Therefore, answer is 259.\\n\\nWait, but need to check units: all given lengths AE, CF=84, AB=63, BC=448. No unit specified, answer is within the same units, so 259.\\n\\nBut given that the problem is geometrical, is there another way by coordinate system to verify?\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe by parameterizing EF.\\n\\nLet me parameterize line EF from E(0,84) to F(63,364). The coordinates of a general point on EF can be expressed as E + t*(F - E) where t in [0,1].\\n\\nF - E vector is (63,364 -84) = (63,280). So parameterizing EF: (0 +63t,84 +280t). So coordinates are (63t,84 +280t) for t from 0 to1.\\n\\nNow, if P is at t=14/287≈0.0487, but actually steps:\\n\\nFrom E to P is 14 units. Total length is287, so t=14/287, similarly Q is at t=273 distance from E, t=273/287.\\n\\nTherefore, coordinates of P and Q:\\n\\nFor P: (63*(14/287),84 +280*(14/287))\\n\\nFor Q: (63*(273/287),84 +280*(273/287))\\n\\nCompute PQ distance:\\n\\nDifference in x-coordinates: 63*(273/287 -14/287)=63*(259/287)=63*(259/287)\\n\\nDifference in y-coordinates: 280*(273/287 -14/287)=280*(259/287)=280*(259/287)\\n\\nThus, PQ is sqrt[(63*(259/287))² + (280*(259/287))²]\\n\\nBut 63 and280 are the horizontal and vertical components of EF, length 287. So multiplying each component by (259/287) horizontally and (259/287) vertically. Then the total length would be sqrt[(63*(259/287))² + (280*(259/287))²] = (259/287) * sqrt(63² +280²) = 259/287 *287=259. So PQ=259. Hence proves correctly the calculation. Therefore PQ=259.\\n\\nGood, that matches the earlier reasoning. So answer is 259. Seems confirmed by coordinate approach.\\n\\nTherefore, box the answer.\", 'answer': '259'}\n",
      "{'question': 'The $52$ cards in a deck are numbered $1, 2, \\\\cdots, 52$ . Alex, Blair, Corey, and Dylan each pick a card from the deck randomly and without replacement.

Find $m+n$ .', 'solution': 'Okay, let\\'s tackle this probability problem step by step. So we have a deck of 52 cards numbered 1 to 52. Alex, Blair, Corey, and Dylan each pick a card randomly without replacement. The two with lower numbered cards form one team, and the two with higher numbered cards form the other team. We need to find the minimum probability p(a) where p(a) is the probability that Alex and Dylan are on the same team, given that Alex picks either card a or a+9, and Dylan picks the other one. Then express that minimum p(a) as a fraction m/n with m and n coprime, and find m + n.\\n\\nFirst, I need to understand the setup. So, given that Alex has either a or a+9, and Dylan has the other, what is the probability that they are on the same team. The teams are determined by the lower two and higher two cards among all four picked. So if Alex and Dylan\\'s cards, along with Blair and Corey\\'s cards, are such that both Alex and Dylan are among the two lowest or two highest, then they are on the same team.\\n\\nWe need to find p(a) as a function of a, then determine its minimum value where p(a) >= 1/2, and write that as m/n.\\n\\nLet me break it down. So suppose Alex picks card a, Dylan picks a+9, or vice versa. Either way, we need to consider their positions relative to the cards picked by Blair and Corey.\\n\\nWait, but Blair and Corey are picking two other distinct cards from the remaining 50 cards. So depending on what Blair and Corey pick, either Alex and Dylan (who have a and a+9) are both in the lower half or both in the higher half.\\n\\nSo first, set the premise: Alex and Dylan have cards a and a+9. Let\\'s assume Alex has a and Dylan has a+9. Since the problem doesn\\'t distinguish between them picking one or the other, it\\'s symmetric. So whether Alex has the lower or higher card, the analysis would be the same. Therefore, p(a) is the same regardless of which card Alex or Dylan took, so maybe we can treat them as fixed for the analysis.\\n\\nSo the team assignments depend on the other two cards picked by Blair and Corey. Let Blair and Corey\\'s cards be two distinct numbers from the remaining 50 (i.e., not a or a+9).\\n\\nThen, the four cards are a, a+9, and two others (let\\'s call them x and y). The two lower cards will form one team, and two higher cards will form another team. So for Alex and Dylan (a and a+9) to be on the same team, both a and a+9 must be either in the two lowest cards or in the two highest cards of the four.\\n\\nSo the probability p(a) is the probability that both a and a+9 are in the two lowest or two highest when combined with Blair and Corey\\'s cards x and y.\\n\\nTo compute this probability, perhaps we can fix Alex\\'s and Dylan\\'s cards as a and a+9, then analyze the positions of the other two cards x and y.\\n\\nNote that x and y are two distinct cards from the set {1,...,52} excluding a and a+9. So there are 50 cards remaining. Blair and Corey pick any two different of these.\\n\\nNow, question is: to find the probability that in four cards (a, a+9, x, y), both a and a+9 are either the two lowest or two highest.\\n\\nThis can be separated into two cases:\\n\\nCase 1: Both a and a+9 are the two lowest. Then x and y must both be higher than a+9.\\n\\nCase 2: Both a and a+9 are the two highest. Then x and y must both be lower than a.\\n\\nSo the probability p(a) is the sum of the probabilities of Case 1 and Case 2.\\n\\nSo to compute p(a):\\n\\np(a) = [Number of ways x and y are both higher than a+9] + [Number of ways x and y are both lower than a] divided by total number of possible (x, y) pairs.\\n\\nTotal number of possible (x, y) pairs: the two cards Blair and Corey pick are from 50, so C(50, 2) = (50*49)/2 = 1225.\\n\\nFor Case 1: x and y both higher than a+9. There are cards numbered from a+10 up to 52. The number of such cards is 52 - (a+9) = 52 -a -9 = 43 -a.\\n\\nWait: a+9 is a card, so the higher cards would start from a+10 up to 52. So the number of such cards is (52 - (a + 9)) = 43 - a.\\n\\nTherefore, the number of ways Blair and Corey can pick two higher cards is C(43 - a, 2). Similarly, for Case 2: x and y both lower than a, which would be from 1 to a-1. So number of such cards is a -1. Therefore, the number of ways Blair and Corey pick two lower cards is C(a -1, 2).\\n\\nHence, the probability p(a) = [C(43 - a, 2) + C(a -1, 2)] / C(50, 2).\\n\\nSimplify that:\\n\\nC(n,2) is n(n-1)/2. Therefore, numerator: [ (43 -a)(42 -a)/2 + (a -1)(a -2)/2 ] / 1225.\\n\\nCombine numerator: [ (43 -a)(42 -a) + (a -1)(a -2) ] / 2 divided by 1225.\\n\\nTherefore, p(a) = [ (43 -a)(42 -a) + (a -1)(a -2) ] / (2 * 1225 )\\n\\nLet me calculate this expression:\\n\\nLet me compute the expression (43 -a)(42 -a) + (a -1)(a -2). Let\\'s expand both terms.\\n\\nFirst, (43 -a)(42 -a) = (43)(42) - 43a -42a + a² = (1806 -85a + a²)\\n\\nSecond, (a -1)(a -2) = a² -3a + 2\\n\\nSo sum these two:\\n\\n1806 -85a +a² + a² -3a +2 = 2a² -88a +1808\\n\\nThus, numerator becomes 2a² -88a +1808\\n\\nTotal denominator was 2*1225=2450\\n\\nThus, p(a) = (2a² -88a +1808)/2450\\n\\nThis fraction can be simplified perhaps?\\n\\nLet me factor numerator and denominator. Numerator is 2a² -88a +1808. Let\\'s divide numerator and denominator by 2:\\n\\nNumerator: a² -44a +904\\n\\nDenominator: 2450 /2=1225\\n\\nSo p(a) = (a² -44a +904)/1225\\n\\nHence, p(a) = [a² -44a + 904]/1225.\\n\\nNow, we need to find the minimum value of p(a) which is >= 1/2.\\n\\nBut first, maybe check if p(a) is a function of a, quadratic in a. Let\\'s note that this function will be a parabola. Since the coefficient of a² is positive (1), parabola opens upwards. Therefore, the minimum will be at the vertex.\\n\\nWait, but the problem asks for the minimum value of p(a) where p(a) >= 1/2. Wait, that phrasing might need clarification.\\n\\nWait the original problem: \"the minimum value of p(a) for which p(a) >= 1/2\". Hmm. Wait perhaps it\\'s phrased that the minimum a such that p(a) >= 1/2. But the question translates again:\\n\\nLet p(a) be the probability that Alex and Dylan are on the same team, given that Alex picks one of a or a +9, and Dylan picks the other. The minimum value of p(a) for which p(a) >= 1/2 can be written as m/n..., i.e., find the minimal p(a) such that p(a) is at least 1/2, and when that p(a) is achieved at a minimal value (since p(a) is varying as a quadratic, which first reaches equal to 1/2 and then is higher? Wait now, if parabola opens upward, p(a) is minimized at vertex, so if vertex has value below 1/2, so then the value at some a would cross 1/2, so the minimal a where p(a) crosses 1/2 would be the minimal p(a), but I need to see.\\n\\nWait, actually, maybe recheck the original problem\\'s wording: \"the minimum value of p(a) for which p(a)\\\\ge\\\\frac{1}{2}\". Wait, this is phrased a little ambiguously. Wait, but given that p(a) is defined for certain a\\'s, i.e., given a card pair a and a+9, so they must exist in the deck. So a must be from 1 to 43, because a+9 must be <=52, so the maximum a is 52-9=43. So if a is from 1 to 43.\\n\\nTherefore, p(a) is defined for a in 1 through 43. We need to find, over those a, the minimum p(a) such that p(a) >=1/2. So when computed all p(a) for a from 1 to43, p(a) is a quadratic function (parabola) opening upward (because coefficient a² is positive). Therefore, p(a) reaches minimum at vertex, which is a*-vertex. So the vertex is at a= -b/(2a) in quadratic ax² +bx +c, but here our quadratic is [ (a² -44a + 904) /1225].\\n\\nSo the quadratic in a is a² -44a +904. So vertex is at a = 44 /2 =22. So when a=22, the quadratic is minimized.\\n\\nTherefore, the minimum value of p(a) occurs at a=22. But we need check whether at a=22 does p(a) >=1/2, otherwise, look when p(a)=1/2 and take minimal.\\n\\nWait, confusion here: the problem wants to find the minimum value of p(a) (i.e., the smallest p(a)) which is still greater or equal to 1/2. So, presuma: p(a) varies with a, reaches a minimum somewhere, but the user isn\\'t looking for the global minimum. They are looking for the minimal p(a) that satisfies p(a) >=0.5. So perhaps the lowest p(a) among all a where p(a)>=0.5, possibly the cutoff at the point where p(a)=0.5.\\n\\nBut given that p(a) is a parabola opening upward, its minimum is at a=22. If at that point p(22) is >= 0.5, then that\\'s the minimal p(a) over all a where it\\'s >=0.5. Or else, perhaps the minimal p(a) over all a is already lower than 0.5, so then the minimal a where p(a)>=0.5 would be earlier. Wait no, the minimum value meaning the minimal p(a) of the ones that meet or exceed 1/2. So if in the parabola, after a certain point, p(a) crosses above 0.5, and plots positívně, that the vertex is above 0.5, the smallest value in that range is the vertex.\\n\\nBut perhaps...\\n\\nWait actually, really confused here. Let me think again.\\n\\nSuppose p(a) is a parabola that is minimized at a=22. If at the minimum, p(a) is still at least 1/2, then 22 would be the answer, as the minimum p(a). If otherwise, if at the minimum, p(a) falls below 1/2, then the solutions would be boundaries where p(a) reaches 1/2.\\n\\nWait we need to see what p(22) is. Compute p(22).\\n\\np(a)= [a² -44a +904]/1225\\n\\nCompute when a=22: 22² =484, 44*22=968, 904 is the additive.\\n\\nSo numerator: 484 -968 +904. 484 -968 is -484. -484 +904 = 420.\\n\\nSo p(22)= 420 /1225 = reduce that. 420 divides by 35: 12, 1225 divides by 35 is 35. So 420 /1225= 12/35≈0.342857... which is ≈34.28%, which is below 1/2.\\n\\nTherefore, vertex gives a minimum p(a) value of 12/35, which is way below 1/2. Therefore, for values of a near extreme values (a very low or very high), p(a) will be higher.\\n\\nWait since when a is 1, for instance, then:\\n\\np(a) as per the formula, [1² -44*1 +904]/1225= (1 -44 +904)/1225=861/1225≈70.3%. Similarly, when a is 43,\\n\\nSimilarly, 43² -44*43 +904= (1849 -1892 +904)= (1849 -1892 = -43; +904 gives 861) same as a=1. So 861/1225≈70.3%. So highest possible p(a) is 861/1225≈0.703, which is the maximum.\\n\\nNow, p(a) has a parabola shape with maximum at 1 and 43 (matching as both ends have a=1 and43 yield same numerator, 861) and the minimum in the middle at a=22 with p(a)=0.342. So since parabola opens upwards, we\\'re showing p(a) decreasing from a=1 to a=22, then increasing back to a=43. But since 0.342 is the minimum, which is still below 1/2, the parabola dips below 1/2.\\n\\nBut the problem requires the minimum value of p(a) where p(a)>=1/2, so among the a\\'s where p(a)>=0.5, the minimal p(a) is that 0.5 or some higher value. But in reality, the regions of a where p(a)>=0.5 start from at two endpoints: first, as a increases, p(a) declines but before it falls below 0.5 starts increasing. Wait no. Wait possible Once p(a) >=0.5 occurs in two intervals:\\n\\nBut since parabola dips below 0.5, there might be two ranges: from a=1 to somewhere k the higher =from symmetrically left to ke, maybe.\\n\\nWait parabola p(a) starts high at a=1 (0.7), decreases until a=22 (~0.342), then increases to a=43 again. So if 0.5 is less than both the ends, in their slopes, the threshold between.\\n\\nTherefore, probably the a\\'s where p(a)>=0.5 are at the extremes of a and of the high a\\'s. So between a=1 to until some lb where p(a)=0.5, and similarly from some ub until a=43, with middle p(a) too low.\\n\\nTherefore, the minimal p(a) which is minor would be at the point near where p(a) is 0.5 in these crossings.\\n\\nHence, perhaps the minimal p(a) ≥1/2 is when p(a) =1/2. So find the a closest to the center that p(a)=0.5, and the minimal value of p(a) that has to satisfy p(a)>=1/2 is 1/2 itself. But perhaps depending on how well the number\\'d alignment.\\n\\nBut need to check and solve for which a does [a² -44a +904]/1225=1/2.\\n\\nSolve:\\n\\n(a² -44a +904)/1225 = 1/2\\n\\nMultiply numerator by 2: 2a² -88a +1808 =2450\\n\\n=>2a² -88a +1808 -2450=0\\n\\n=>2a² -88a -642=0\\n\\nDivide by 2:\\n\\na² -44a -321=0\\n\\nQuadratic equation: a² -44a -321=0\\n\\nSolving discriminant: D=44² +4*321=1936 +1284=3220.\\n\\nWait 44 squared is 44*44=1936. 4*321=1284, adding gives 1936+1284=3220. sqrt(3220). Hmm, is there an integer sqrt here?\\n\\nLet me see how 3220 factors. 3220=100*32.2, but sqrt(3220)=around 56.7, since 56 squared is 3136, 57 squared is 3249. So approximately 56.7. Wait exact sqrt as? 3220.\\n\\nWait 3220 can be broken into 4*805. Because 3220=4*805. So sqrt(4*805)=2*sqrt(805). Again sqrt(805); 805 is around 28.3 since 28 squared is 784, 29 squared is 841. So sqrt(805) irrational. Therefore, quadratic equation will yield irrational roots.\\n\\nTherefore, the solutions to a² -44a -321 =0 are:\\n\\na = [44 ± sqrt(3220)] /2 ≈ [44 ±56.7]/2.\\n\\nSo positive roots:\\n\\n(44 +56.7)/2≈100.7/2≈50.35\\n\\n(44 -56.7)/2≈-12.7/2≈-6.35\\n\\nSince a ranges from 1 to 43, only possibly the root near 50.35 is way over 43—it\\'s not inside a range. The negative root is invalid.\\n\\nWait, probably there is no real a in 1 to43 for solutions p(a)=0.5.\\n\\nBut how does p(a) function constructed. For a=43:\\n\\np(43)= [43² -44*43 +904]/1225 = [1849 -1892 +904] = 1849-1892= -43 +904=861 /1225≈70.3%, as before.\\n\\nSimilarly, let me check for a=mid where p(a)=low at 22 (~34%). So crosses under 0.5.\\n\\nBut since the parabola begins at a=1 with p(a)=70.3% then goes down to 34% and back up, but given that 0.5 is below 70.3%, so when leaving a=1, decreasing but does p(a) ever go, for other a near beginning, maybe it\\'s exceeds 0.5 past when?\\n\\nWait the function parabola opening upward, minimum at a=22, but the starting point at a=1 is high. So when you? These: from a=1 onwards, p(a) decreases until a=22, then increases.\\n\\nBut only increasing back towards a=43. So there must be a certain a where p(a)=0.5 somewhere between the minima and maxima before. But compute when moving towards mid a=p(a) is decreasing.\\n\\nWait but given that when a=1, p(a)=861/1225≈0.703; with a=22, ≈0.35. So like linear decrease(looks), but actually quadratic.\\n\\nWait, let\\'s compute some middle a\\'s, near where a=22 and as you approach.\\n\\nWait maybe to check if there is a symmetrical hitting of the p(a)=0.5?\\n\\nAlternatively, there\\'s a move in solving whether m/n= probability greater than or equal to 0.5 needs.\\n\\nBut the problem says find the minimum value of p(a) for which p(a)>=1/2. That is, the least probability value that still meets the threshold of 1/2. Minimal value >=1/2, so in this case, minimal as in the smallest m/n fraction that satisfies m/n >=1/2. But says: the minimal p(a). Which occurs when?\\n\\nIf p(a) is lowering smoothly from a=1 to a=22 and then rising back. So after a minimal p(a) near 0.342 (which is too low), but near upper sides.\\n\\nWait. So as a increases from1 to 22, p(a) is decreasing. But when a=1, p=∼70%, a starts going, and when a=?? occurs that p(a)=0.5?\\n\\nBut apparently, from computation when checking equation  a=-44a/ decision making, the roots at 50.35 >43 invalid, so within a=1 to43, the p(a) of 0.5 is not attainable.\\n\\nBut wait, this is conflicted with initial Computation. Let me another way approach!\\n\\nAlternative approach.\\n\\nAssume that Alex has cards a and a+9 (fixed). Then the other two players get two cards from remainings 50.\\n\\nIn order for Alex and Dylan to be on same team, required that either both Blair and Corey have higher cards above a+9 (so the two lower are a, a+9), or both Blair and Corey have lower cards below a (so highest two are a, a+9).\\n\\nP(a) = [C(higher cards) +C(lower cards)] /C(50,2).\\n\\nHigher cards: a+9 is value. So higher cards as strictly> a+9. Which are 52 - (a+9) = 43 -a. Similarly, lower cards are strictly <a. This is 1,2,…,a-1. These is count(a-1).\\n\\nProbability is [ C(43 -a,2)+C(a-1,2) ] /C(50,2).\\n\\nGiven that, above 1/2?\\n\\nCompute where:\\n\\nC(43 -a,2)+C(a-1,2) ≥ C(50,2)/2.\\n\\nWhich is 1225/2=612.5\\n\\nThus need:\\n\\nC(43 -a,2)+C(a-1,2)≥ 613\\n\\nSo equality when hits 613.\\n\\nComputation numerators: So set (43 -a)(42 -a)/2 + (a-1)(a-2)/2 >= 1225/2.\\n\\nThus numerator：(43 -a)(42 -a) + (a -1)(a -2) >= 1225.\\n\\nAs before, sum that we saw:\\nexpression (expand out): 43*42=1806 as term when a=0\\n\\nRemove dependencies:\\n\\nSum=(43 -a)(42—a) + (a—2)(a—1 )\\n\\nWhich we expand gives, as calculated before, 2a² -88a +1808. Hence equation:\\n\\nThese 2a² -88a+1808 >= 2450, as per [ text occurs when p(a) >=1/2. Helden:\\n\\nWait sorry, Here wait, when setting the two combinations sum to >= 1225 (probability >= 1/2).\\n\\nWait earlier step:\\n\\nWait p(a) = [C(43 -a,2)+C(a-1,2)] /1225.\\n\\nTherefore, the numerator needed to be >= 1225 (≥1225 *0.5=612.5)\\n\\nBut since the numerator, as summed, we are getting:\\n\\n[(43 -a)(42 -a) + (a -1)(a -2)/>\\n\\n Which is (43*42 -85a +a²)+( a² -3a +2)>= (1806 -85a +a² + a² -3a +2) = 1808 -88a +2a².\\n\\nTherefore, sum is 2a² -88a +1808. To have p(a) >=0.5:\\n\\nsum >= 612.5, but actually since p(a) = (sum)/1225 >=1/2.\\n\\nTherefore 2a² -88a +1808 >=1225. Because sum is numerator over denominator must be at least 1/2. So:\\n\\nIndeed, 2a² -88a +1808 >= (1225. Or proceed to:\\n\\n2a² -88a +1808 >= 1225, so subtract 1225:\\n\\n2a² -88a +1808 -1225 >=0. So 2a² -88a +583 >=0.\\n\\nDivide by 2:\\n\\na² -44a +291.5 >=0.\\n\\nSolve a² -44a +291.5 =0.\\n\\nDiscriminant: D=44² -4*1*291.5=1936 -1166=770.\\n\\nWait sqrt(770), approximate asissqrt(770≈1approx. 27.7, etc) But quadratic equation:\\n\\na= [44 ±sqrt(770)] /2≈ [44±27.7]/2. So ±27.7: 44+27.7=71.7/2≈35.85. 44-27.7=16.3/2≈8.15.\\n\\nThus, critical points at a≈8.15 and a≈35.85. Since p(a)\\'s quadratic equation above. Originating equation sign is parabola upward.\\n\\nHence, inequality a² -44a +291.5≥0 holds when a<=8.15 or a>=35.85. But since integers a is from 1 to 43. Then possible a<=8 (8.15) or a>=36 (35.85). Therefore \"interal a must be <=8 or >=36.\\n\\nTherefore, to have p(a)>=1/2, a must be <=8 or>=36. Thus confirming that p(a) is above 50% only at a=1 to a=8 and a=36 to a=43. So now, in the intervals a=1-8 and a=36-43.\\n\\nTherefore, the minimum value of p(a) within these intervals would be at a=8 and a=36, because p(a) is decreasing from a=1 to a=8 and increasing from 36 to 43 (based on quadratic parabola).\\n\\nThus the minimal p(a) that is >=1/2 likely happens at the edge of the intervals which is closest to center: i.e., for a=8 and as we approach the center, p(a) small, and similarly for a=36. Which corresponds with reasoning the minimum p points.\\n\\nHence, we need to compute a=8 and a=36.\\n\\nCompute p(8):\\n\\nNumerator: (43 -8=35)C(35,2) + C(7,2) = 35*34/2 +7*6/2= 35*17=595 +21=616. denominator=1225.\\n\\nThus p(8)=616/1225. Simplify 616=56*11. 1225=25*49. Check gcd: 616 and1225. Factors:\\n\\n616: divisible by 8 (7divides), but 1225 is 35 squared, prime factors 5 and7.\\n\\n616=8*77=8*7*11\\n\\n1225=5²*7². GCD is 7? 616 divided by7 is88. 1225 divided by7 is175. So gcd=7.\\n\\nThus 616/1225 →88/175. Therefore m=88, n=175, which gcd？\\n\\n88 and175: 88=8*11, 175=25*7. No common factors. So inful stractrelatively Irinel.\\n\\nIs 88 and175 coprime? 88: factors 2,4,8, factor 11. 175 factors 5,7,35. No overlap. yes, So gcd is1. Then p(a)=88/175 approx 50.2857%, wait aka approximately=0.502857, is over 0.5.\\n\\nFor a=8: p(a)=616 /1225~0.5028 So exactly 616/1225=8*77 /25*49= 8/25 *11/7√ No ratio.\\n\\nBut reduced it: 616 /1225. GCD(616,1225)= GCD(616,1225)= factors numerators:\\n\\n616=8x77=8x7x11.\\n\\n1225=25x49=5^2x7^2.\\n\\nCommon factor is 7. So 616 divided by 7=88, 1225 divided by7=175. Hence 88/175 as reduced fraction.\\n\\nWait. Therefore, p(8)=88/175. Similarly compute a=36:\\n\\np(36):\\n\\nCancor:\\n\\n43 -36=7, So higher cards:7. Ways C(7,2)=21. Lower cards: a-1=35. C(35,2)=595.\\n\\nHence total=21+595=616. same as a=8. So similarly p(36)=616/1225=88/175≈0.502857.\\n\\nSo So , when a=8 or a=36, we have p(a)=88/175, which≈50.28%, which is slightly above 1/2. Then for a\\'s lower than 8 or higher than 36, the probabilities higher.\\n\\nFor a=7:\\n\\np(7):\\n\\nC(43 -7=36 ,2)+C(6,2)= C(36,2)= (36*35)/2=630 +15=645.645/1225≈52.65%. higher.\\n\\nSimilarly a=37:\\n\\n43-37=6, so C(6,2)=15, a-1=36: sample. Cort(36,2rmsiq)/same =630 +15=645. Same p as a=7.\\n\\nTherefore indeed the minimal p(a)>0.5 happens at a=8 or36, with exactly88/175.\\n\\nHence, m +n=88+175=263.\\n\\nBut wait, converting that.\\n\\nConfirm under inputting processy.\\n\\nWaitGeneral35628้อง<think>\\n\\nAlright, let\\'s break this down through critical steps.\\n\\n**Problem Statement:**\\nFour players each pick a card from a deck of 52 (numbered 1-52).

      "{'question': 'Compute $\\\\sqrt{(31)(30)(29)(28)+1}$ .', 'solution': 'Okay, so I need to compute the square root of (31×30×29×28) plus 1. That looks like a big number, maybe there\\'s a pattern or a shortcut to simplify it instead of just calculating each step normally. Hmm. Let me think...\\n\\nFirst, let me write down the expression inside the square root: 31×30×29×28 + 1. That seems to be multiplying four consecutive numbers—wait, no, 31, 30, 29, 28—they are four consecutive numbers going downwards by 1 each time, right? So 31, 30, 29, 28—each is one less than the previous. Wait, actually, the order is from 28 to 31 ascending if we reverse them. Let me note that.\\n\\nI remember sometimes when you have products of consecutive numbers plus 1, it might relate to some square numbers. For example, 1×2×3×4 +1 is 25, which is 5². Or maybe another example: 2×3×4×5 +1 = 121, which is 11². Wait, does this pattern hold? Let me check.\\n\\nFor 1×2×3×4: 1×2=2, 2×3=6, 6×4=24. Then 24 +1=25, which is 5². Then for 2×3×4×5: 2×3=6, 6×4=24, 24×5=120. 120 +1=121=11². So here, maybe there\\'s a connection where n(n-1)(n-2)(n-3) +1 is a square? Let\\'s check with the first example. If n=4, then 4×3×2×1+1=24 +1=25=5². So for n=4, it\\'s 5². For n=5 (products 5×4×3×2=120 +1=121=11²). Hmm here, 5² when n=4, 11² when n=5. Wait, maybe not a direct relation. Wait another sequence.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe if we take the product as (n)(n-1)(n-2)(n-3) +1, maybe that equals something squared. Let me try n=5: 5×4×3×2=120, 120+1=121=11². For n=6: 6×5×4×3=360, 360+1=361=19². Wait, 11², 19². Wait, 11,19—the differences here might be 8. Let me see if there\\'s a relationship. 5^2=25, 11^2=121, 19^2=361. If pattern is 5,11,19..., perhaps \"+6\", \"+8\"? Unclear. Maybe it\\'s related to the central numbers in the product. Looking for another pattern.\\n\\nWait, in the first example (n=4): 1×2×3×4 +1 =5². Which is (4+1)^2=5². Wait, no. For n=5: 2×3×4×5 +1=121=11². So 11 is like (3×4)+ something. Wait 3×4=12. 11 is 12 minus 1? Maybe. Similarly 5²: (2×3) minus 1: 5=6-1. If that is a coincidence, maybe. Let me see.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe the number inside the square is (a×b +1), but in n(n-1)(n-2)(n-3) +1 = (some term). Maybe expanding the product. Let me try in general. Let’s consider the product n(n-1)(n-2)(n-3). Maybe this can be expressed as a polynomial. Let\\'s multiply step by step.\\n\\nFirst, multiply n(n-1) = n² -n. Then multiply (n-2)(n-3) = (n² -5n +6). Then multiply (n² -n)(n² -5n +6). Let me compute that:\\n\\nFirst: (n² -n)(n² -5n +6) = n²(n² -5n +6) -n(n² -5n +6)\\n= n⁴ -5n³ +6n² -n³ +5n² -6n\\n= n⁴ -6n³ +11n² -6n.\\n\\nSo product n(n-1)(n-2)(n-3) equals n⁴ -6n³ +11n² -6n. Then adding 1, we have:\\n\\nn⁴ -6n³ +11n² -6n +1.\\n\\nWait, maybe this quartic polynomial is a square of something, like a quadratic? Let\\'s suppose that it is equal to (n² + an + b)². Expand that:\\n\\n(n² + an + b)² = n⁴ + 2a n³ + (a² + 2b) n² + 2ab n + b².\\n\\nComparing to our quartic polynomial:\\n\\nn⁴ -6n³ +11n² -6n +1.\\n\\nSo setting equations:\\n\\nCoefficient of n⁴: 1=1, okay.\\n\\nCoefficient of n³: 2a = -6 --> a = -3.\\n\\nCoefficient of n²: a² + 2b = 11. Since a=-3, then (-3)^2 +2b =9 +2b=11 => 2b=2 => b=1.\\n\\nCoefficient of n: 2ab=2*(-3)(1)=-6= which matches.\\n\\nConstant term: b²=1²=1, also matches.\\n\\nAh! Therefore, n(n-1)(n-2)(n-3) +1 = (n² -3n +1)².\\n\\nSo if this holds, then sqrt(n(n-1)(n-2)(n-3) +1) = n² -3n +1. That seems to be universal based on our deduction? Let\\'s verify with the examples above.\\n\\nWhen n=4: product is 4×3×2×1 +1=24 +1=25. Then (4² -3*4 +1)=16-12+1=5, 5²=25. Perfect.\\n\\nn=5: product is 5×4×3×2 +1=120+1=121. (5² -15 +1)=25-15+1=11, 11²=121. Also matches. Great.\\n\\nSimilarly, for example which might encountered before: n=6: 6×5×4×3 +1=360 +1=361. Then (6² -3*6 +1)=36-18+1=19, and 19²=361. So this formula seems solid.\\n\\nTherefore, the general formula is:\\n\\nsqrt(n(n−1)(n−2)(n−3)+1} = n² − 3n + 1.\\n\\nSo applying this to the problem here.\\n\\nWait, the problem is: Compute sqrt{(31)(30)(29)(28) +1}\\n\\nSo here, the product is 31×30×29×28 +1.\\n\\nSo in terms of the expression above, if we let n=31, then the product would be 31×30×29×28 = 31×(30×29×28). Wait but according to our formula, n(n-1)(n-2)(n-3), which for n=31: 31×30×29×28, exactly. Therefore, that product plus 1 equals (31²−3×31+1)². So the square root would be 31²−3×31+1. Let me compute that:\\n\\n31 squared: 31×31=961.\\n\\n3×31=93.\\n\\nSo 961 -93 +1=961 -92=869. Wait, 961-93=868, then +1=869.\\n\\nWait, 93 is subtracted from 961, so 961-93=868, then add 1, you get 869. Wait another way, 31² = 961. 3n =93. Subtract 93 from 961 gives 868. Adding 1 gives 869. Therefore, sqrt{(31)(30)(29)(28) +1} is 869.\\n\\nLet me check once more with another number. For example, n=7.\\n\\n7×6×5×4=840. 840 +1=841=29². Now, 7²−3×7+1=49−21+1=29, 29²=841, correct.\\n\\nSo the formula works here and for earlier numbers, so it\\'s safe to use for n=31, so answer is 31²−3×31+1=869. Thus, sqrt{31×30×29×28 +1}=869. So boxed answer is \\\\boxed{869}.\\n\\nBut let me just verify with actual computation. Let\\'s compute 31×30×29×28 first:\\n\\n31×30=930. Then 930×29= 930×20=18600, 930×9=8370, total 18600 +8370=26970. Then 26970×28. Let\\'s compute 26970×20=539,400. 26970×8=215,760. So total 539400 + 215760=755,160. So 31×30×29×28=755,160. Then add 1:755,161.\\n\\nNow computing square root of 755,161. Let\\'s verify 869².\\n\\nCompute 800²=640,000. 60²=3,600. So rough 800+60=860. Wait, 800²=640,000. 869 squared can be written as (800 +69)^2. So 800² + 2×800×69 +69². That is 640,000 +2×800×69 +69².\\n\\nFirst compute 2×800×69= 1600×69.\\n\\n1600×60=96,000.\\n\\n1600×9=14,400.\\n\\n96,000 +14,400=110,400.\\n\\nThen 69²=4761.\\n\\nSo total is 640,000 +110,400 =750,400 +4,761=755,161. Exactly. Therefore, 869²=755,161. Therefore, sqrt{755,161}=869. Thus, the original problem answer is 869. So confidence is high. So I can conclude.', 'answer': '869'}\n",

Find $m+n$ .', 'solution': \"Alright, so I have this problem where I need to find the value of sinθ given that P/Q equals 2√2/7. Both P and Q are these infinite series with alternating terms involving cosine and sine functions, multiplied by coefficients that are powers of 1/2. The domain given is π ≤ θ < 2π, so θ is in the lower half of the unit circle, meaning sinθ could be negative or positive, but since the answer requires sinθ = -m/n, that tells me sinθ is negative. Interesting.\\n\\nFirst, I need to figure out what these series P and Q represent. They have alternating signs, coefficients decreasing by 1/2 each time, and switching between cos and sin terms with increasing multiples of θ. For example, P starts with 1/2 cosθ - 1/4 sin2θ - 1/8 cos3θ + 1/16 sin4θ... So the pattern seems to alternate cosine, sine, cosine, sine..., and each term's coefficient is 1/(2^n), where n increases by 1 each term. Also, the angle is multiplied by 1, 2, 3, 4, etc. Similarly, Q starts with 1 and follows a similar alternating pattern but starts with coefficients and functions differently: 1 - 1/2 sinθ - 1/4 cos2θ + 1/8 sin3θ... So perhaps Q is a similar series but starting with a constant term 1, then alternates between sine and cosine.\\n\\nHmm. Infinite series that involve trigonometric functions with coefficients in geometric progression. This looks similar to Fourier series, but perhaps these are power series or generated by some complex function. Alternatively, maybe they can be expressed in terms of a generating function or using complex numbers.\\n\\nAnother approach: since the coefficients are 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, etc., each term is half the previous term's coefficient. So each term is multiplied by (1/2)^n, where n is 1,2,3... But with angles kθ where k increases. Hmmm.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe writing the series in terms of complex exponentials. Since cos and sin can be written as combinations of e^{i kθ} and e^{-i k θ}, since coskθ = (e^{ikθ} + e^{-ikθ}) / 2 and sinkθ = (e^{ikθ} - e^{-ikθ}) / (2i). If I rewrite P and Q using complex exponentials, the coefficients might form a geometric series that can be summed.\\n\\nLet me try this for P. First, let's look at P:\\n\\nP = 1/2 cosθ - 1/4 sin2θ - 1/8 cos3θ + 1/16 sin4θ + 1/32 cos5θ - 1/64 sin6θ - 1/128 cos7θ + ...\\n\\nSo, starting with 1/2 cosθ, next term is -1/4 sin2θ, then -1/8 cos3θ, then +1/16 sin4θ, then +1/32 cos5θ, then -1/64 sin6θ... So maybe there's a pattern in the sign: +, -, -, +, +, -, -,... Hmmm. Each two terms have a pattern? Wait, maybe the sign alternates every two terms? Let's check first:\\n\\nTerm 1: 1/2 cosθ (positive)\\n\\nTerm 2: -1/4 sin2θ (negative)\\n\\nTerm 3: -1/8 cos3θ (negative)\\n\\nTerm 4: +1/16 sin4θ (positive)\\n\\nTerm 5: +1/32 cos5θ (positive)\\n\\nTerm 6: -1/64 sin6θ (negative)\\n\\nTerm 7: -1/128 cos7θ (negative)...\\n\\nSo signs: +, -, -, +, +, -, -, +, +... So every two terms, the sign cycles: +, -, then -, +, then +, -, etc.? Wait, perhaps the sign alternates every two terms? Let me list the coefficients:\\n\\nTerm 1: +1/2 cosθ\\n\\nTerm 2: -1/4 sin2θ\\n\\nTerm 3: -1/8 cos3θ\\n\\nTerm 4: +1/16 sin4θ\\n\\nTerm 5: +1/32 cos5θ\\n\\nTerm 6: -1/64 sin6θ\\n\\nTerm 7: -1/128 cos7θ\\n\\nTerm 8: +1/256 sin8θ...So here, after two terms, the sign pattern changes. So in terms of n, for term n:\\n\\nIf n mod 4 is 0 or 3, then positive? Not clear. Alternatively, maybe the pattern is that each block of two terms has the same sign, and sign alternates every two terms. Let's check:\\n\\nTerm 1 and 2: + then -\\n\\nTerm 3 and 4: - then +\\n\\nTerm 5 and 6: + then -\\n\\nTerm 7 and 8: - then +. So alternately two terms with a +- and -+ and so on. Maybe this is a more complicated pattern we can capture with (-1)^n or something?\\n\\nAlternatively, complex approach. Let's consider z = something involving e^{iθ}. Because each of the terms are coskθ and sinkθ, which can be written in terms of e^{ikθ} and e^{-ikθ}.\\n\\nAlternatively, suppose that these series P and Q can be expressed as real and imaginary parts of some complex geometric series. Let me try constructing such a series.\\n\\nAssume that S = some complex series like Q + i P, or similar.\\n\\nWait, let's see Q:\\n\\nQ = 1 - 1/2 sinθ - 1/4 cos2θ + 1/8 sin3θ + 1/16 cos4θ - 1/32 sin5θ - 1/64 cos6θ + 1/128 sin7θ + ...\\n\\nSimilarly, pattern here is alternation between sine and cosine terms. Starting with 1, first term is -1/2 sinθ, then -1/4 cos2θ, then +1/8 sin3θ, +1/16 cos4θ, then -1/32 sin5θ, etc. So perhaps Q can be written as sum over k from 0 to infinity, with terms as alternating functions.\\n\\nLet me think. Perhaps both P and Q could be related to the real and imaginary parts of a complex series. Let me define a complex function:\\n\\nLet z = sum_{n=0}^infty [ (-1)^n (1/2)^n e^{i (n+1)θ} ]?\\n\\nWait, not sure. Let me try for S = Q + i P. Let's see:\\n\\nQ is 1 - 1/2 sinθ -1/4 cos2θ +1/8 sin3θ +1/16 cos4θ -1/32 sin5θ etc.\\n\\nIf we add i P to Q: Q + i P = 1 -1/2 sinθ -1/4 cos2θ +1/8 sin3θ +1/16 cos4θ… +i*(1/2 cosθ -1/4 sin2θ -1/8 cos3θ…).\\n\\nSo term by term:\\n\\n1 (real)\\n\\nNext term: -1/2 sinθ (real) + i*(1/2 cosθ)\\n\\nNext term: -1/4 cos2θ (real) + i*(-1/4 sin2θ)\\n\\nNext term: +1/8 sin3θ (real) + i*(-1/8 cos3θ)\\n\\nNext term: +1/16 cos4θ (real) + i*(1/16 sin4θ)\\n\\nNext term: -1/32 sin5θ (real) + i*(1/32 cos5θ)\\n\\nAnd so on.\\n\\nIf we look at each pair, the terms can be expressed in terms of e^{ikθ}.\\n\\nFor example, the second term: -1/2 sintheta + i*(1/2 costheta) = i*(1/2 (cosθ + i sinθ)) = i*(1/2 e^{iθ} )\\n\\nSimilarly, the third term: -1/4 cos2θ + i*(-1/4 sin2θ) = -1/4 (cos2θ + i sin2θ) = -1/4 e^{i2θ}\\n\\nFourth term: +1/8 sin3θ + i*(-1/8 cos3θ ) = (1/8)(sin3θ - i cos3θ) = -i (1/8)(cos3θ + i sin3θ) = -i/8 e^{i3θ}\\n\\nFifth term: +1/16 cos4θ + i*(1/16 sin4θ) = 1/16 (cos4θ + i sin4θ) = 1/16 e^{i4θ}\\n\\nWait, hmmm, perhaps there's a pattern here. Therefore Q + i P is:\\n\\n1 +\\n\\ni*(1/2 e^{iθ}) -\\n\\n1/4 e^{i2θ} -\\n\\ni/8 e^{i3θ} +\\n\\n1/16 e^{i4θ} +\\n\\ni/32 e^{i5θ} -\\n\\n1/64 e^{i6θ} - ... \\n\\nThis series alternates signs every two terms, with coefficients decreasing by 1/2 each term, and also multiplying by -i each term. Maybe perhaps more generally:\\n\\nNotice the sequence:\\n\\nAfter the initial term 1, each subsequent term can be seen as multiplied by -i/2 e^{iθ} and then compounded?\\n\\nWait, perhaps writing S = Q + i P.\\n\\nLet S = Q + i P.\\n\\nThen S can be written as 1 + sum_{n=1}^infty term.\\n\\nLooking at each term:\\n\\nTerm at n=1: i*(1/2 e^{iθ})\\n\\nTerm at n=2: -1/4 e^{i2θ}\\n\\nTerm at n=3: -i/8 e^{i3θ}\\n\\nTerm at n=4: +1/16 e^{i4θ}\\n\\nTerm at n=5: +i/32 e^{i5θ}\\n\\nTerm at n=6: -1/64 e^{i6θ}\\n\\nTerm at n=7: -i/128 e^{i7θ}\\n\\nTerm at n=8: +1/256 e^{i8θ}...\\n\\nObserving the sequence, the coefficient for term n is (-i/2)^n, and the exponent is e^{i n θ} ?\\n\\nCheck:\\n\\nn=1 term: (-i/2)^1 = -i/2, but coefficient is i/2. But not exactly.\\n\\nWait: Term 1: coefficient -i/2 would be -i/2, but the term is i/2 e^{iθ}. So let's see if:\\n\\nperhaps coeff * e^{iθ} where coeff is (-i/2)^1.\\n\\nWait, (-i/2)^1 = -i/2 multiplied by e^{iθ} gives -i/2 e^{iθ}.\\n\\nCompare to term 1: i/2 e^{iθ} which is not -i/2 e^{iθ}. Hmm, inverse.\\n\\nIs maybe something multiplied by -i starting.\\n\\nWait. Maybe the series S follows a pattern multiplying by a factor each time:\\n\\nTerm 1: 1.\\n\\nTerm 2: term 1 multiplied by -i/2 e^{iθ} ?\\n\\nWait, starting.\\n\\nWait, suppose S = 1 + a_1 e^{iθ} + a_2 e^{i2θ} + a_3 e^{i3θ} + ...\\n\\nFrom the terms:\\n\\na_1 = i/2\\n\\na_2 = -1/4\\n\\na_3 = -i/8\\n\\na_4 = 1/16\\n\\na_5 = i/32\\n\\na_6 = -1/64\\n\\na_7 = -i/128...\\n\\nEach coefficient a_n is ( -i/2 )^n ?\\n\\nCheck:\\n\\nFor n=1: ( -i/2 )^1 = -i/2, but a1 is i/2 ; not same.\\n\\nn=2: ( (-i/2)^2 ) = (-i/2)^2 = ( -i )^2 * 1/4 = (-i)^2 = ( -1 )^2 i^2 = i^2 = -1, so coefficient for n=2 would be ( -1 *1 /4 ), which is -1/4, matching a2 = -1/4.\\n\\nFor n=1: *no. If ( -i/2 )^n from n=1 to onwards:\\n\\nIf we define S = sum_{n=0}^\\\\infty ( (-i/2 )^n e^{i n θ } ), then perhaps:\\n\\nsum = 1 + (-i/2 e^{iθ }) + ( (-i/2 e^{iθ} )^2 + ... + ( (-i/2 e^{iθ} )^n ).\\n\\nWait, as a geometric series.\\n\\nBut in our case, S seems to differ.\\n\\nWait, let's compute the generating function. If S is a geometric series, then S = 1 / ( 1 - r ) where r is each term multiplied successively. Let me test that.\\n\\nCurrent series seems to be:\\n\\nAt n=0: 1\\n\\nn=1 term: i/2 e^{i θ}\\n\\nn=2 term: (-1/4) e^{i 2θ }\\n\\nn=3 term: (-i/8) e^{i3θ}\\n\\nn=4 term: 1/16 e^{i4θ}\\n\\nn=5 term: i/32 e^{i5θ}\\n\\n\\nHmm. Compare ratio between terms:\\n\\nterm n=1 divided by term None – since 1 is n=0, term n=1 to term n=0 is ( i/2 e^{iθ} ). term n=2 to term n=1: ( -1/4 e^{i2θ} ) / ( i/2 e^{iθ} ) = ( -1/4 e^{i2θ} ) / ( i/2 e^{iθ} ) = (-1/4) / (i/2) * e^{iθ}. Equal to (-1/4 * 2/i ) e^{iθ} = ( -1/(2i ) e^{iθ ). Which is (-1/(2i)) e^{iθ}. Not a constant ratio. Hmmm. So this might not be geometric.\\n\\nBut in coefficient terms; the coefficients for e^{ikθ} are being multiplied by factors.\\n\\nFor example coefficients:\\n\\nBetween term n=0 (1) and term n=1: i/2. From 1 comes into here? If we factor out for term1 compared to term0: no.\\n\\nIf check term2 coefficient (-1/4) compared to term1's i/2: (-1/4)/(i/2) = ( -1/4 ) * 2 / i = (-1/2i) = ( i/2 )\\n\\nBecause 1/(i) is -i, so (-1/2i ) = (-1/2 ) * ( -i ) = i/2\\n\\nSimilarly term3 coefficient (-i/8 ) compared to term2 coefficient (-1/4 ) : ( -i/8 ) divided by ( -1/4 ) = ( i/8 ) / (1/4 ) = i/2\\n\\nSimilarly term4 (1/16 ) divided by term3 (-i/8 ) gives (1/16 ) * (8/-i ) = (8/16)/-i = (1/2)/-i = ( -1/2i ) = (i/2 )\\n\\nSo indeed the ratio is between terms' coefficients is multiplying by i/2 each time.\\n\\nSo if S = n=0 term 1 + n=1 term (i/2 e^{iθ} ) + n=2 term likewise....\\n\\nSince the ratio between coefficient-term n+1 and term n is (i/2). So this forms a geometric series with each term multiplied by (i/2) * e^{iθ ?)\\n\\nWait, actually after Term n=0 (1), Term n=1 is (i/2) e^{iθ }\\n\\nTerm n=2 is (i/2) * (i/2) e^{i(θ +θ )} } but  |\\n\\nWait, it might fits as S can be expressed as sum_{n=0}^\\\\infty (i/2 e^{iθ} )^n.\\n\\nWait: (i/2 e^{iθ} )^0 = 1, term 0.\\n\\n(i/2 e^{iθ} )^1 = i/2 e^{iθ}\\n\\n(i/2 e^{iθ} )^2 = (i/2)^2 e^{i2θ} = (-1/4) e^{i2θ }\\n\\n(i/2 e^{iθ} )^3 = (i/2)^3 e^{i3θ } = ( -i/8 ) e^{i3θ }\\n\\n(i/2 e^{iθ} )^4 = (i/2)^4 e^{i4θ } = (1/16 ) e^{i4θ }\\n\\nWhich is matching the coefficients observed:\\n\\nYes, for each term n, the coefficient is (i/2 e^{iθ})^n. Hence, S is a geometric series. Therefore sum S = sum_{n=0}^\\\\infty ( (i/2 e^{iθ} )^n ) = 1/(1 - (i/2 e^{iθ} ) ), since geometric series sum is 1/(1 - ratio ) if ratio^n.\\n\\nTherefore, S = 1 / (1 - (i/2 e^{iθ}) )\\n\\nBut asked earlier I compiled S as Q + i P. So therefore Q + i P = 1 / (1 - (i/2 e^{iθ}) )\\n\\nTherefore, given that:\\n\\nS = Q + i P = 1 / [ 1 - (i/2 e^{iθ) ) ]\\n\\nTherefore, to compute P and Q:\\n\\nIf S = Q + i P, then Q = Re(S), and P = Im(S)/ i.\\n\\nAlternatively, split S into real and imaginary parts.\\n\\nBut perhaps compute S first.\\n\\nFirst, compute 1 - (i/2 e^{iθ} ) as denominator:\\n\\n1 - (i/2 e^{iθ} ) = 1 - i/2 (cosθ + i sinθ )\\n\\nWait, because e^{iθ} = cosθ + i sinθ\\n\\nTherefore,\\n\\nDenominator = 1 - i/2 ( cosθ + i sinθ )\\n\\n= 1 - i/2 cosθ - (i^2)/2 sintheta\\n\\n=1 - i/2 cosθ + 1/2 sinθ (since i^2 = -1).\\n\\nThus,\\n\\nDenominator = (1 + 1/2 sinθ ) - i (1/2 cosθ )\\n\\nWhich is written denominator = A - i B, where A = 1 + (sinθ)/2, B = (cosθ)/2\\n\\nTherefore, then S (which = 1 / denominator )= reciprocal.\\n\\nTo compute reciprocal of complex number (A - i B ) , multiply by conjugate over modulus squared. So,\\n\\nS = [ (A + i B) ] / (A^2 + B^2 )\\n\\nThus,\\n\\nS = [ (1 + 1/2 sinθ + i (1/2 cosθ ) ) ] / [ (1 + 1/2 sinθ )^2 + (1/2 cosθ )^2 )\\n\\nThus,\\n\\nQ + i P = [ (1 + (sinθ)/2 ,  ( cosθ)/2 ) ] divided by denominator denominator squared + something.\\n\\nWait, let me write:\\n\\nNumerator: (A + i B ) = ( (1 + 1/2 sinθ ) + i * (1/2 cosθ ) )\\n\\nDenominator: (A^2 + B^2 ) = (1 + 1/2 sinθ )^2 + (1/2 cosθ )^2 )\\n\\nTherefore, splitting numerator into real and imaginary parts:\\n\\nReal part: 1 + (1/2) sinθ = Q\\n\\nImaginary part: 1/2 cosθ = P (since Q + i P = numerator )\\n\\nWait no. Wait S was equals Q + i P. However, according to this,\\n\\nQ + i P = ( A + i B ) / (A^2 + B^2 )\\n\\nTherefore,\\n\\nQ is ( A ) / (A^2 + B^2 )\\n\\ni P is ( i B ) / (A^2 + B^2 ), so P = B / (A^2 + B^2 )\\n\\nWhere A = 1 + 1/2 sinθ, B = 1/2 cosθ\\n\\nTherefore,\\n\\nQ = (1 + 1/2 sintheta ) / denominator\\n\\nP = (1/2 costheta ) / denominator\\n\\nwhere denominator = A^2 + B^2.\\n\\nTherefore,\\n\\nThen P/Q is [ (1/2 cosθ ) / denominator ] / [ (1 + 1/2 sinθ ) / denominator ] = (1/2 cosθ ) / (1 + 1/2 sinθ )\\n\\nSo P/Q = [ (1/2 cosθ ) / (1 + 1/2 sintheta ) ] which equals ?\\n\\nGiven that P/Q = 2√2/7, so:\\n\\n[ (1/2 cosθ ) / (1 + 1/2 sintheta ) ] = 2√2 /7\\n\\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\\n\\nMultiply both sides:\\n\\n(1/2 cosθ) = (2√2 /7 ) * (1 + 1/2 sinθ )\\n\\nMultiply both sides by 2:\\n\\ncosθ = (4√2 /7 ) * (1 + 1/2 sintheta )\\n\\nTherefore,\\n\\ncosθ = (4√2/7) + (4√2/14) sinθ\\n\\nThus need equation:\\n\\ncosθ - (4√2/14 ) sinθ = 4√2/7\\n\\nDerive this equation. Now, we have:\\n\\nBut need to solve this equation based on cosθ and sinθ.\\n\\nLet me write:\\n\\ncosθ - (4√2/14 ) sinθ = 4√2/7\\n\\nSimplify the coefficient:\\n\\n4√2/14 is (2√2)/7. So:\\n\\ncosθ - (2√2/7 ) sinθ = (4√2)/7. * Wait 4sqrt2/7 ?\\n\\nWait, let me check: 4sqrt2/14 is sqrt2/  14/4? Wait 4√2/14 simplifies to 2√2 /7, yes.\\n\\nSo cosθ - (2√2/7 ) sinθ = 4sqrt2/7.\\n\\nTherefore, equation is:\\n\\ncosθ - (2√2/7 sinθ ) = 4√2 /7.\\n\\nWe can express this as:\\n\\nLet me call M = sinθ, which we are to find.\\n\\nExpress cosθ in terms of M.

Huh? Wait 19=19 times 1, but denominator is 57? Is 19/57=1/3. But 19 divided by 57 is? 57/19=3, thus 19/57=1/3. Wait 19/57  is 1/3:\\n\\nWait 19*3=57, so 19/57=1/3. Right. So sintheta=( -32+70)/114=38/114=1/3.\\n\\nAnother possibility: sintheta=( -32 -70 )/(114)=(-102)/114= (-17)/19 ). Since gcd(17,19)=1, so. So sintheta could be 1/3 or -17/19.\\n\\nBut in the problem, it is given that π ≤ theta <2π, so sintheta is negative. sot sintheta is -17/19 ? Because sintheta=1/3 is positive, while another is -17/19.\\n\\nBut check substitute back into equation.\\n\\nIf sintheta=1/3, which is positive, but theta is in pi<= theta<2 pi; implicitly sintheta should be negative. So sintheta=- - but in problem answer is -m/n, which they’re found integers, prime, so m and n. In the equation, 57 sin² theta +32 sintheta -17=0...\\n\\nSolutions are sintheta=1/3 or sintheta= -17/19. Ok. As sintheta=1/3 is about 0.333, not on the domain since theta is lower half, sintheta negative so sintheta= -17/19.\\n\\nThus sintheta=-17/19. but check gcd(17,19)=1, so m=17,n=19.\\n\\nAnswer m+n=17+19=36.\\n\\nWait but we should check if solution satisfies the original equation?\\n\\nBut step by step verify.\\n\\nLet me first substitute sintheta= -17/19 into the equation.\\n\\n57 sin² theta +32 sintheta -17=0 ?\\n\\nCompute:\\n\\nsinθ =-17/19.\\n\\nsin² theta=(289)/361.\\n\\nSo,\\n\\n57*(289/361)+32*(-17/19)-17 =\\n\\nCompute:\\n\\n57*(289)/361:\\n\\n57 divides 361? 361=19*19. 57=3*19, so 57*289=3*19*289=3*289*19.\\n\\nWait,\\n\\n(57*289)/361 = (57*289)/ (19*19)= (57)/(19)*289/(19) =3*289/19. 289=17^2, 289 divides by19? 19*15=285, 289 is 285+4, so no. 289/19≈15.21 so fraction.\\n\\nWait thusit is fractional.\\n\\nLet me compute numerically:\\n\\n57 *289=57*289. 57*200=11400,57*89=5073→11400+5073=16473.\\n\\nDivide by 361: 16473/361 ≈45.65\\n\\nThener term 32*(-17/19)=-544/19≈-28.63\\n\\nTotal:\\n\\n45.65 -28.63 -17=45.65 -45.63=0.02.

      "{'question': 'Let $R$ be the set of all possible remainders when a number of the form $2^n$ , $n$ a nonnegative integer, is divided by 1000. Let $S$ be the sum of the elements in $R$ . Find the remainder when $S$ is divided by 1000.', 'solution': \"Okay, so I need to find the set R which consists of all possible remainders when a number like 2^n (where n is a nonnegative integer) is divided by 1000. Then, sum all those remainders to get S and finally find the remainder when S is itself divided by 1000. \\n\\nFirst, let's break down what this means. When dividing 2^n by 1000, the remainder can be from 0 to 999. But since 2^n can be really large, the remainder should eventually repeat because there's only a finite number of possible remainders (mod 1000). So the set R will be a collection of these unique remainders that cycle after some period. Then summing them up and modulo 1000 again.\\n\\nFirst step is probably to determine the cycle length, i.e., how the remainders repeat. Since 1000 is 8 * 125, maybe using modulus properties here. But 1000 factors into 2^3 * 5^3. Maybe Chinese Remainder Theorem can help here? Breaking modulus 8 and modulus 125 and combining them?\\n\\nWait, the remainders modulo 1000 would correspond to pairs of remainders modulo 8 and modulo 125. So if I can find the cycles modulo 8 and modulo 125 separately, then find the combined cycle modulo 1000. Then each element in R corresponds to a unique combination of remainder modulo 8 and modulo 125. Therefore, the set R can be found by combining the residues from modulo 8 and modulo 125 parts.\\n\\nFirst, let's handle modulus 8: 2^n mod 8. Since 2^n for n=0:1, n=1:2, n=2:4, n=3:0, n≥3:0 again. Wait, 2^3=8 is 0 mod 8, and any higher power of 2 will also be 0 mod 8. Wait, actually:\\n\\nWait, starting from n=0:\\n\\nn=0: 1 mod 8\\nn=1: 2 mod 8\\nn=2: 4 mod 8\\nn=3: 0 mod 8\\nn=4: 0 mod 8...\\nSo modulo 8, the residues cycle as 1,2,4,0,0,...\\n\\nSo modulus 8 is a cycle length of 3 before dropping to 0 and stays zero thereafter. Wait, but once it hits 0, it's zero forever. So in R, when considering modulus 8, the residues possible are 1,2,4,0. But for modulus 1000, the full residue can be anything combining these with the modulus 125.\\n\\nBut maybe first, let's figure out cycle for modulus 125. Powers of 2 modulo 125. Hmm. 125 is 5^3. Let's see.\\n\\nFind the multiplicative order of 2 modulo 125.\\n\\nSince 125 is coprime to 2? Wait, 2 and 125 are coprime (gcd(2,125)=1). So multiplicative order exists. The order is the smallest integer k such that 2^k ≡ 1 mod 125.\\n\\nEuler's theorem tells us that 2^φ(125) ≡ 1 mod 125. φ(125)=125*(1 - 1/5)=100. So 2^100 ≡ 1 mod 125. Maybe order divides 100. So we need to find k dividing 100 where 2^k ≡ 1 mod 125.\\n\\nTo compute the order, likely factor 100 into primes: 2^2 * 5^2.\\n\\nTest divisions:\\n\\nStart with 20: 2^20 mod 125. Let's compute 2^10=1024 mod 125=1024-8*125=1024-1000=24. Then 2^20=24^2=576 mod 125=576-4*125=576-500=76. So not 1.\\n\\nCheck 25: 2^25. But 2^20 is 76, then 2^25=76*2^5. 2^5=32, so 76*32=2432. 2432 mod 125: 2432 - 19*125=2432-2375=57.\\n\\nNot 1. Continue to 50: Let's compute 2^50. If 2^20=76, then 2^40=76^2 mod 125. 76*76=5776. 5776 mod 125: 5776 - 46*125=5776 - 5750=26. Then 2^50=26*2^10. 2^10 is 24, so 26*24=624. 624 mod 125=624-5*125=624-625=-1 mod 125, which is 124. So 2^50 ≡124 mod 125. Not 1. So order not 50.\\n\\nCheck higher divisor: 100 maybe? Because 100 is what Euler's theorem gave. Let's compute 2^100. Let's use exponents:\\n\\n2^20=76.\\n\\n2^40=(76)^2=26 mod 125\\n\\n2^60=26*2^20=26*76. 26*76=1976. 1976 mod 125:1976 -15*125=1976-1875=101\\n\\n2^80=101*2^20=101*76=7676. 7676 mod 125:7676-61*125=7676 -7625=51\\n\\n2^100=51*2^20=51*76=3876. 3876 mod 125:3876 - 31*125=3876 -3875=1. So 2^100 ≡1 mod 125. So the order is indeed 100. Therefore, in modulus 125, 2^k is periodic with cycle length 100. So residues for modulus 125 cycle every 100 steps. So modulo 125 residues are a cycle of length 100.\\n\\nTherefore, combining with the modulus 8 part: modulus 8 residues cycle as 1,2,4,0,..., but start repeating zeros once n >= 3.\\n\\nSo modulo 1000 = 8*125, combining the residues. So when n < 3, modulus 8 residues are 1,2,4. For n >=3, modulus 8 residue is 0.\\n\\nSo residue modulo 1000 for 2^n can be written as residue = a mod 8 and b mod 125. For n <3: residues mod 8 (a=1,2,4 for n=0,1,2 respectively); and residues mod 125 (b=2^n mod 125) for all n. For n >=3: residue mod 8 is 0, and residue mod 125 is 2^(n) mod 125, which cycles every 100 steps. So there's an overlap. The total set R is going to consist of:\\n\\n1. The residues for n=0,1,2, which are 1 mod 1000, 2 mod 1000, 4 mod 1000.\\n\\n2. Starting from n=3 onwards, residues of 0 mod 8 and a cycle of residues modulo 125. Therefore, those residues are each of 0 mod 8 combined with the residues of 2^n mod 125 for n=3 to n=102 (since order is 100 modulo 125), but adjusting for starting at n=3.\\n\\nWait, actually since in modulus 125, the period is 100. So starting from n=3, 2^n mod 125 = 2^3 * 2^(n-3) mod 125. So since 2^(n-3) cycles every 100, so starting at n=3, the cycle length is 100. Therefore, modulo 125 part cycles every 100, so modulo 1000, combinations would be 0 (mod8) paired with each of the 100 residues from modulus 125, starting from 8 (2^3=8) mod125? Wait, n=3: 8 mod125=8; n=4=16... when n=3, it's 8 mod125, then follows 2^n mod125 cycle starting from n=3? But as multiplicative cycle, starting from n=3, incrementing n shifts the exponent.\\n\\nWait, multiplicative order in 125 is 100, so if starting at n=3 and then n increases, the exponents in modulus 125 form a multiplicative group starting at 8(=2^3), so it's 8*2^k mod125 for k >=0. Since 8 is coprime with 125: 8 and 125 are coprime (gcd=1). Therefore, the multiplicative order of 8 in 125 can be calculated. Alternatively, since 2 has order 100 in modulus125, then 8=2^3 has order 100/gcd(3,100). Since gcd(3,100)=1, thus the order of 8 is the same as order of 2, which is 100. Thus, 8 in modulus 125 has a multiplicative order of 100, meaning that when multiplied by itself, cycles every 100.\\n\\nTherefore, for n >=3, 2^n mod125 is 8*2^(n-3) mod125, which is equivalent to 8*(2^k) mod125 where k = n-3. Since 2^k mod125 cycles every 100 steps, so 8*(2^k) will also cycle every 100 steps. Wait, but maybe each multiple in there could reduce or but same cycle?\\n\\nAlternatively, if 2^k mod125 has a cycle of 100, then multiplying by a fixed constant (8) preserves the cycle length, just shifts it. So 8*2^k mod125 as k increases also cycles every 100. So regardless, the residues from modulus 125 when n >= 3 cycle every 100 steps. Therefore, modulo 125 part for n >=3 cycles after 100, hence modulo 1000, residues n >=3 cycle every 100.\\n\\nBut modulo 8, residues for n >=3 are zero. So the complete residues for modulus 1000 compose mod8=0 and mod125 cycles each period 100. Then, from n=3 onwards, residues mod1000 are cosets (0, x) with x cycles 100 different residues mod125. So x is 8*2^k mod125 for k from 0 to 99, which gives 100 distinct residues since the multiplicative order is 100. Therefore, each of those 100 x's are different, hence the total residues for n >=3 would be 100 distinct numbers mod1000 (each with mod8=0 and mod125 being these unique numbers.)\\n\\nTherefore, the total set R is:\\n\\n- Residues for n=0:1; n=1:2; n=2:4.\\n\\n- Residues for n >=3: 100 residues, each 0 mod8 and distinct mod125. Thus, total R has 3 + 100 = 103 elements.\\n\\nBut wait, is that correct? For n=3: 8 mod125 is 8. So modulo1000 is 8. For n=4:16 mod125 is 16? Do those modulo125 numbers from n=3 to n=102 (100 numbers) all not repeat?\\n\\nYes because under modulus 125, since the multiplicative order is 100, when k=0 to 99, cycle through 100 distinct values. Therefore, different residues.\\n\\nTherefore, residues from n=3 onward are 100 distinct numbers mod1000 (i.e., 0 mod8 and consecutive 2^n mod125, each unique).\\n\\nHence R = {1, 2, 4} union {eight,16,..., complex but each mod125 is unique. So 100 residues} the size is 103.\\n\\nThe user is maybe okay, so compute sum S as: 1 + 2 + 4 + sum of residues n >=3. Then find S mod1000.\\n\\nTo compute the sum of the residues n >=3 (mod1000), which are 0 mod8, each being 2^n mod1000 for n=3 onwards but mod1000. Since those residues are cycle 100, sum of that cycle is sum_{k=0}^{99} (8*(2^k)) mod125. But also for modulus 1000, but combined with mod8 being zero.\\n\\nAlternatively, since residues are (0 mod8 and (8*2^k) mod125).\\n\\nTo compute their sum mod1000, first translate each residue into the number mod1000, which satisfies 0 mod8 and x mod125. So Chinese Remainder tells us this number is unique modulo 1000 because 8 and 125 are coprime. Hence, combining mod8=0 and mod125=x gives a unique mod1000 number.\\n\\nTherefore, each k from 0 to 99 gives mod125=x=8*2^k, all unique. The mod1000 numbers would be 8*2^k + 125*m where m is whatever needed to make it divisible by 8, but actually since we need to compute the sum of all residues of form (8*2^k mod125) coupled to (0 mod8). So maybe we just sum 8*2^k mod1000? Wait, but 8*2^k mod1000 is indeed equal to (8*2^k mod125) combined with (0 mod8), as 8*2^k is divisible by 8. So yes, 8*2^k mod1000.\\n\\nTherefore, the sum over n >=3 is sum_{k=0}^{99} (8 * 2^k) mod1000. Therefore, compute this sum S_part = 8*(2^0 + 2^1 + ... + 2^99). 2^0 to 2^99 is a geometric series S = 2^100 - 1. Hence S_part=8*(2^100 -1). Then, Our total sum S = 1 + 2 + 4 + 8*(2^100 -1). Then compute S modulo1000.\\n\\nBut 2^100 mod 125 is known from earlier calculations? Earlier, we saw that 2^100 ≡1 mod125. And 2^100 mod8=0, since 2^3=8 mod8=0, all higher are 0. So 2^100 mod1000 = However, 2^100 is ≡1 mod125 and ≡0 mod8. Therefore, by Chinese Remainder Theorem to represent 2^100 mod1000.\\n\\nWe find number congruent to 0 mod8 and 1 mod125. The solution is x = 1 mod125, and divisible by 8. Let’s compute the smallest x≡1 mod125 and x≡0 mod8. Let x = 125k + 1. Then need 125k +1 ≡0 mod8, which is 125k ≡ -1 mod8. 125 mod8=5, so 5k ≡ -1 mod8, which is 5k≡7 mod8. Multiply by inverse of 5 mod8.5 and 8: since gcd(5,8)=1, inverse can be found. 5*5≡25≡1 mod8, no. 5* 1=5, 5*3=15≡7 mod8. So inverse of 5 is3. Then k≡7*3=21≡5 mod8. Therefore k=8m +5. So x=125*(8m +5)+1=1000m + 626. Hence 2^100 mod1000=626.\\n\\nTherefore, 2^100=626 +1000m for some integer m.\\n\\nThus, 2^100-1=625 +1000m'. Therefore, S_part =8*(625 +1000m')) so S_part=8*625 +8*1000m'=5000 +8000m'.\\n\\n5000 mod1000=0, and8000m' mod1000=0. So S_part mod1000=0.\\n\\nWait, that seems confusing. Let me double-check.\\n\\nWe found that 2^100 ≡626 mod1000 (because 626 mod8=626-78*8=626-624=2? Wait, wait no:Wait 616 divides by8 as77 *8=616. 626=616+10. 10 mod8=2. So 626 mod8=2? But previous step said x=626 mod125=1? \\n\\nBut original computation had x to be mod125=1 and mod8=0. So existing that must be incorrect. Wait.\\n\\nPreviously, in calculating 2^100 mod1000. We said because mod125 it is 1 and mod8 it is 0. So seeking number congruent to 1 mod125 and 0 mod8. To compute such x.\\n\\nSo the steps we have that 2^100 mod125=1, as proven when earlier 2^100≡1 mod125. However, modulus 8, as 2^100 = (2^4)^25=0 mod8. So 2^100≡0 mod8 and≡1 mod125. Hence x=0 mod8 and x=1 mod125. So find x such that: x ≡1 mod125 and x≡0 mod8. As the Chinese Remainder would find that.\\n\\nWe can find such x by solving equations:\\n\\nLet x=125k, (must be congruent to0 mod8 and 125k ≡1 mod 8)\\n\\nWait.\\n\\nActually x≡1 mod125 so x=125k +1. Then x≡0 mod8, so 125k +1 ≡0 mod8=>125k ≡-1 mod8.\\n\\n125 mod8=5, since 125=15*8+5. Therefore, equation becomes 5k≡ -1 mod8 =>5k≡7 mod8.\\n\\nMultiply both sides by inverse of 5 mod8. Since 5*3=15≡7 mod8. So 3*5k≡3*7=>15k≡21≡5 mod8? Wait let me try again.\\n\\nequation is 5k ≡7 mod8. To solve for k.\\n\\nMultiply around by inverse of 5. 5 and 8 coprime. 5 inverse modulo 8:\\n\\nLooking for a number m where 5m ≡1 mod8. Test m=5:25≡1 mod8? 25-3*8=1. Yep. So inverse of 5 mod8 is5. Therefore, multiply both sides of 5k≡7 mod8 by5: 5*5k≡5*7 =>25k≡35 mod8. 25=1 mod8, so k≡35 mod8. 35 mod8=7*5=35-4*8=35-32=3. So 35 mod8=3. Hence k≡3 mod8. So minimal k=3.\\n\\nHence x=125*3 +1=376. 376 mod8=376-47*8=376-376=0. 376 mod125=375+1= 376-3*125=376-375=1. So correct, x=376. Thus, 2^100 mod1000=376.\\n\\nWait contradiction here in previous reasoning. Initially thought it's 626, but correct is 376.\\n\\nWait then need why?\\n\\nEarlier user steps had claimed 1000m +626. But made mistake in inverse calculation.\\n\\nStep repeat:\\n\\nLet’s solve x ≡0 mod8 and x≡1 mod125.\\n\\nFind x=125k +1 must≡0 mod8. 125k +1≡0 mod8 =>125k≡-1 mod8.\\n\\n125 mod8 = 5. So equation becomes 5k≡-1 mod8 =>5k≡7 mod8.\\n\\nFind k, Multiply both sides by Inverse of 5 mod8, which is:\\n\\nLooking for m:5m≡1 mod8, m=3 since 5*3=15≡7 mod8? No 15 mod8=7. Wait, no:15-1*8=7, but 7≡7≠1. Wait, test m=5: 5*5=25≡1 mod8. Therefore inverse of 5 mod8 is5.\\n\\nTherefore, multiply both sides of 5k≡7 mod8 by inverse m=5:\\n\\nk≡5*7 mod8=35 mod8=35 -4*8=35 -32=3. Thus, k≡3 mod8.\\n\\nSo k=8t +3, then x=125*(8t +3)+1=1000t +376.\\n\\nHence minimal x=376, hence 2^100 mod1000=376.\\n\\nTherefore, arriving at wrong answer earlier due to miscalculating inverse. So right answer is 376. That said, 2^100 ≡376 mod1000.\\n\\nTherefore 2^100 -1=375.\\n\\nTherefore S_part =8*(2^100 -1)=8*375=3000. 3000 mod1000=0. Omg. Again, So the sum R_part=sum over n >=3 is 3000 mod1000 is 0.\\n\\nThen total sum S=1+2+4+0=7. Therefore modulo1000, answer 7.\\n\\nWait that seems surprising, guess. That conclusion seems shocking. Let me check again.\\n\\nThe argument goes that:\\n\\nThe sum of the terms for n >=3 is sum_{k=0}^{99} 8*2^k, which is 8*(2^{100} -1). Then, 2^{100} ≡376 mod1000. Thus, 8*(376 -1)=8*375=3000. 3000 mod1000=0. So sum for n>=3 gives 0, while sum n=0,1,2 is 7, gives total S=7. Therefore, ans=7.\\n\\nBut step keypoint: determine whether sum_{n>=3} 2^n mod1000 sum is equivalent to summing8 * sum_{k=0}^{99}2^k, then 8*(2^{100} -1)..\\n\\nWait, maybe need adjust exponent period.\\n\\nWait... When n=3, term is 8.\\nn=4:16\\n...\\nEach term here is 2^n /16 divided by remainder mod1000. Forms 8,16,32, etc. mod1000.\\n\\nBut modulo 125 they form 8*2^k. But for exponents k=0 to99. Sum of 8*(2^k) for k=0 to99. Each term is 8*2^k mod1000. Hence summation is 8*(sum_{k=0}^{29}2^k). What properties.\\n\\nSum_{k=0}^{99}2^k=2^{100}-1. Thus sum of that geometric series is valid.\\n\\nThus 8*(2^{100} -1). But mod1000.\\n\\nPreviously found 2^100 mod1000 is376. Hence 2^{100}-1=375, so 8*(375)=3000. 3000 mod1000=0. So yes.\\n\\nTherefore sum of terms for n>=3=0 mod1000.\\n\\nSo total sum S=1+2+4+0=7 mod1000.\\n\\nBut...\\n\\nWait, but query with caseing like, perhaps the formula mentions sum_{k=0}^{99} 2^k. But 2^k goes from exponent 0 to 99. But when n >=3，terms are starting at exponent n=3， but if so, Start term is k=0 being 8*2^0=8. But involved n=3 is8，equivalent to 2^3.\\n\\nThen step： sum_{n=3}^{∞}2^n mod1000 residues sum. Since residues cycle every 100 terms n=3 to n=102, then the cycle is 100 terms. meaning sum_{n=3}^{102}2^n mod1000 residues= sum_{k=0}^{99}8*2k mod1000.\\n\\nOnce off：Therefore it's in modulus properties, actually, exactly. So the sum of residues for n>=3 is equal to the sum of residues over the cycle, which is 100 residues, and for modulus1000, each cyclic term: residues repeat every 100 terms.\\n\\nTherefore summing all residues for n >=3 gives just sum over one cycle, since every subsequent cycle would necessarily apport the same residues. So regardless the total sum would here require Sum of residue cycle= sum of blocks of residues for modular repetitions.\\n\\nBut assuming that problem's set R includes the cycle residues. So. So previously my reasoning is proper.\\n\\nHence conclusion is:\\n\\nS mod1000= (1 +2 +4+ 0) mod1000=7.\\n\\nBut before accept, Step 1:Check the modulus of 2^100 is 376 mod1000. Earlier process deduced that. However, let's verify step for 2^100. Compute 2^10 mod1000:\\n\\nEarlier Knew that 2^10=1024 mod1000=24.\\n\\nThen 2^20=24^2=576 mod1000=576.\\n\\n2^20 is 576.\\nThen compute 2^40=576^2 mod1000.\\n\\n576 squared: 576*576. I compute 500^2 is250,000, so 576^2= 331, 776. Mod1000=776.\\n\\nThus 2^40 mod1000=776.\\n\\nNext,2^80= (776)^2 mod1000. 776*776 = 776*700=543200, 776*76=58, 496 +543200=601,696. mod1000=696.\\n\\nThen 2^100= 2^80 *2^20=696*576 mod1000. Compute 696*576.\\n\\nCompute 700*576=403,200; subtract 4*576=2304: 403,200 -2304=400,896. Mod1000=896.\\n\\nBut this computation contradicts earlier steps. Wait, previously Eulered out modulus 125 said 2^100 mod125=1, hence multiplied by8 cycles, but modulus1000 different.\\n\\nWait to compute 2^100 mod1000:\\n\\nLet me compute step-wise using exponents:\\n\\n2^1=2\\n2^2=4\\n2^3=8\\n2^4=16\\n2^5=32\\n2^6=64\\n2^7=128\\n2^8=256\\n2^9=512\\n2^10=1024 -> 24 mod1000\\n2^11=48\\n2^12=96\\n2^13=192\\n2^14=384\\n2^15=768\\n2^16=536 (768*2=1536 mod1000=536)\\n2^17=1072 mod1000=72\\n2^18=144\\n2^19=288\\n2^20=576\\n2^21=1152 mod1000=152\\n2^22=304\\n2^23=608\\n2^24=216 mod1000 (608*2=1216)\\n2^25=432\\n2^26=864\\n2^27=728\\n2^28=456\\n2^29=912\\n2^30=824\\n2^31=648\\n2^32=296\\n2^33=592\\n2^34=184\\n2^35=368\\n2^36=736\\n2^37=472\\n2^38=944\\n2^39=888\\n2^40=776\\n2^41=552\\n2^42=104\\n2^43=208\\n2^44=416\\n2^45=832\\n2^46=664\\n2^47=328\\n2^48=656\\n2^49=312\\n2^50=624\\n2^51=248\\n2^52=496\\n2^53=992\\n2^54=984\\n2^55=968\\n2^56=936\\n2^57=872\\n2^58=744\\n2^59=488\\n2^60=976\\n2^61=952\\n2^62=904\\n2^63=808\\n2^64=616\\n2^65=232\\n2^66=464\\n2^67=928\\n2^68=856\\n2^69=712\\n2^70=424\\n2^71=848\\n2^72=696\\n2^73=392\\n2^74=784\\n2^75=568\\n2^76=136\\n2^77=272\\n2^78=544\\n2^79=88\\n2^80=176\\n2^81=352\\n2^82=704\\n2^83=408\\n2^84=816\\n2^85=632\\n2^86=264\\n2^87=528\\n2^88=56\\n2^89=112\\n2^90=224\\n2^91=448\\n2^92=896\\n2^93=792\\n2^94=584\\n2^95=168\\n2^96=336\\n2^97=672\\n2^98=344\\n2^99=688\\n2^100=376\\n\\nYes, compute up to 2^100 step-by-step and arrived at modulo1000.

Which that sum residues n=3 onwards is 0. Then total S=7.\\n\\nThus answer is 7.\\n\\nBut let me test with little code.\\n\\nBut perhaps manually check sum. Let's manual check summation for n=3~something， wait, but method agreed with computations despite being abstract.\\n\\nAlternatively, once residue cycle sums modulus. Let example when modulo 125 behavior.\\n\\nSum cycle：\\n\\nSum of residue mod125 parts for n >=3 can be sum_{k=0}^{99}8*2^k =8*(2^100 -1). Since modulus125, sum that=8*(1 -1)=0？Wait, since 2^100≡1 mod125, then 8*(2^100 -1)=8*(0)=0 mod125. So total sum mod125=0. Also mod8 the sum contributes zero. Then combined sum is 0 mod1000. Hence mod1000, Sum is zero.\\n\\nAlternatively such is making sense? The residues from n >=3 cycle in mod125 Sum=0 and in mod8 Sum= 100 terms each=0 sum=0. Hence overall sum=0 mod1000. Therefore, sum totals=1+2+4 summed r mod1000=7.\\n\\nThus, this answer hence is7.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is\\\\boxed{7}.\", 'answer': '7'}\n",
      "{'question': 'By a proper divisor of a natural number we mean a positive integral divisor other than 1 and the number itself. A natural number greater than 1 will be called \"nice\" if it is equal to the product of its distinct proper divisors. What is the sum of the first ten nice numbers?', 'solution': 'Alright, let\\'s tackle this problem. The question is about finding \"nice\" numbers, which are defined as natural numbers greater than 1 that equal the product of their distinct proper divisors. Proper divisors here are positive integers that divide the number, excluding 1 and the number itself. The task is to find the sum of the first ten nice numbers. Hmm, okay. So I need to figure out what these nice numbers are and then sum the first ten of them.\\n\\nLet me start by understanding better what a nice number is. So, a nice number N has proper divisors (other than 1 and N), and when multiplied together, those proper divisors give N itself. So, if a number N has proper divisors d1, d2, ..., dk, then the product d1*d2*...*dk = N. So, N must be the product of its proper divisors.\\n\\nFirst, maybe list some numbers and check if they are nice. Starting from the smallest natural numbers, as they need to be greater than 1.\\n\\nLet’s start with 2. Proper divisors of 2 would be... Well, divisors of 2 are 1 and 2, but proper divisors are those other than 1 and 2. So, 2 has no proper divisors. Since there are no proper divisors, the product would be... (Empty product is 1, right? So empty product would here be considered? But since the problem says \"other than 1 and the number itself,\" so if there are no proper divisors, then they can\\'t satisfy the condition because there\\'s nothing to multiply. So, 2 is not nice.\\n\\nNumber 3: Similarly, divisors 1 and 3, no proper divisors. Not nice.\\n\\nNumber 4: Divisors are 1, 2, 4. Proper divisor is 2. The product of distinct proper divisors is 2. Which is not equal to 4. So, not nice.\\n\\nNumber 5: Divisors 1, 5. No proper divisors. Not nice.\\n\\nNumber 6: Divisors 1, 2, 3, 6. Proper divisors are 2 and 3. Product of 2*3=6. Oh! That\\'s equal to the number itself. So, 6 is a nice number. Alright, so 6 qualifies.\\n\\nSo, 6 is the first nice number. Let\\'s get that.\\n\\nNumber 7: Divisors 1, 7. No proper divisors. Not nice.\\n\\nNumber 8: Divisors 1, 2, 4, 8. Proper divisors are 2 and 4. Product is 2*4=8. Which is equal to 8. So, 8 is also a nice number. So 8 is the second nice number.\\n\\nWait, that seems contradictory? Let me verify: proper divisors of 8 are 2 and 4. Multiplying 2 and 4 gives 8. So yes, that matches. So 8 is nice.\\n\\nNumber 9: Divisors 1, 3, 9. Proper divisor is 3. Product of proper divisors is 3. 3≠9. Not nice.\\n\\nNumber 10: Divisors 1,2,5,10. Proper divisors are 2 and 5. 2*5=10. So, 10 is nice. Third nice number. So, 6,8,10...\\n\\nLet me confirm up to here. So 6,8,10 are nice. Let\\'s continue.\\n\\nNumber 12: Divisors 1,2,3,4,6,12. Proper divisors are 2,3,4,6. Product of 2*3*4*6.\\n\\n2*3=6, 6*4=24, 24*6=144. 144≠12. So, not nice.\\n\\nNumber 14: Divisors 1,2,7,14. Proper divisors: 2 and 7. Product=14. So, 14 is nice. Fourth!\\n\\nNumber 15: Divisors 1,3,5,15. Proper divisors:3,5. Product=15. So 15 is also nice. Fifth?\\n\\nWait, 14 then 15. So fifth is 15. Wait, numbers so far: 6,8,10,14,15.\\n\\nOkay, let\\'s check higher numbers.\\n\\nNumber 16: Divisors 1,2,4,8,16. Proper divisors: 2,4,8. Product=2*4*8=64≠16. Not nice.\\n\\nNumber 18: Divisors 1,2,3,6,9,18. Proper divisors are 2,3,6,9. Product: 2*3=6, 6*6=36, 36*9=324≠18. So no.\\n\\nNumber 20: Divisors1,2,4,5,10,20. Proper divisors: 2,4,5,10. Product=2*4*5*10=400≠20. Not nice.\\n\\nNumber 21: Divisors 1,3,7,21. Proper divisors 3 and 7. Product=21. Therefore 21 is nice. So sixth nice number:21.\\n\\nNumber 22: Divisors 1,2,11,22. Proper divisors 2 and11. Product=22, which is the number itself. So, seventh is22.\\n\\nSo: 6,8,10,14,15,21,22. Need to find up to ten. Let\\'s check numbers beyond 22.\\n\\nNumber 24: Divisors:1,2,3,4,6,8,12,24. Proper divisors:2,3,4,6,8,12. Product is... Let\\'s compute. 2*3=6, 6*4=24, 24*6=144, 144*8=1152, 1152*12=13824. Not 24. So nope.\\n\\nNumber 25: Divisors1,5,25. Proper divisor is 5. Product=5≠25. Not nice.\\n\\nNumber26: Divisors1,2,13,26. Proper divisors:2 and13. Product=26. So, sixth, seventh now, 26 would be eighth. Wait, but hang on prior steps.\\n\\nWait, earlier after 21 and 22, the next is26, okay? Did I miss some numbers in between?\\n\\nWait, after 22 is 23, but 23\\'s divisors are 1 and 23. No proper divisors. So 23 not nice.\\n\\n24, tried that. 25, not nice. 26, is nice. So, eighth nice number:26\\n\\nNumber 27: Divisors 1,3,9,27. Proper divisors 3,9. Product=27. So, 3*9=27. So, 27 is nice. Ninth.\\n\\nNumber 28: Divisors1,2,4,7,14,28. Proper divisors:2,4,7,14. Product=2*4=8, 8*7=56, 56*14=784≠28. Not nice.\\n\\nNumber 30: Divisors30:1,2,3,5,6,10,15,30.

Proper divisors 3,11; product 3*11=33. Hence, 33 becomes the tenth nice number?\\n\\nWait let\\'s check:\\n\\nStarting from 6,8,10,14,15,21,22,26,27,33. So 10 numbers.\\n\\nBut before, let\\'s check between 27 and 33 to make sure we didn’t skip any.\\n\\nNumbers between 27 and33:\\n\\n28 to 32.\\n\\n28 is done. 29 is prime, divisors 1,29. Not nice.\\n\\n30: not as above.31: prime.32: divisors1,2,4,8,16,32. Proper divisors2,4,8,16. Product2*4*8*16= 2*4=8, 8*8=64, 64*16=1024≠32.\\n\\n33: proper divisors3,11 as mentioned. Product33. So, yes, 33 is nice. Tenth.\\n\\nSo then the first ten nice numbers are:\\n\\n6, 8, 10, 14, 15, 21,22,26,27,33.\\n\\nWait, let\\'s count them to confirm:\\n\\n1:6, 2:8,3:10,4:14,5:15,6:21,7:22,8:26,9:27,10:33. Yes.\\n\\nSo sum them up.\\n\\n6 +6 is first.\\n\\nCalculating:\\n\\n6 +8 =14\\n\\n+10 =24\\n\\n+14=38\\n\\n+15=53\\n\\n+21=74\\n\\n+22=96\\n\\n+26=122\\n\\n+27=149\\n\\n+33=182.\\n\\nTherefore, the sum is 182.\\n\\nBut wait a second.

So total.\\n\\nBut let me verify if my list of nice numbers is accurate.\\n\\nOk, let\\'s re-examine:\\n\\n6: Proper divisors2,3 =>2*3=6. Nice. Correct.\\n\\n8: Proper divisors2,4 =>2*4=8.Nice. Correct.\\n\\n10:Proper divisors2,5 =>2*5=10. Nice. Correct.\\n\\n14:Proper divisors2,7 =>2*7=14. Correct.\\n\\n15:3,5 => 15. Correct.\\n\\n21:3,7 =>21. Correct.\\n\\n22:2,11 =>22. Correct.\\n\\n26: 2,13 =>26. Correct.\\n\\n27:3,9 =>27. Correct.\\n\\n33:3,11 =>33. Correct.\\n\\nEach of these indeed satisfies that N is product of its proper divisors. Then, their sum should be 182.\\n\\nBut Wait, double-add numbers:\\n\\nFirst,  6\\n\\nThen 6 +8 = 14\\n\\nThird:14 +10=24\\n\\nFourth:24 +14=38\\n\\nFifth:38 +15=53\\n\\nSixth:53 +21=74\\n\\nSeventh:74 +22=96\\n\\nEighth:96 +26=122\\n\\nNinth:122 +27=149\\n\\nTenth:149 +33=182.\\n\\nYes, steps are correct.\\n\\nBut to be thorough, are we missing any other numbers?\\n\\nWait, let me check between 14 and15. After14 (number 14 is done), next nice number is15? Between 14 and15—14 comes next. Well 14 is (2—7). Then 15 (3—5). Any number between 14 and15 would be 14.5... Disregard. Next numbers in order. So yes,15 is next. 21,22 following sequence.\\n\\n21 is at 21, so after15 next numbers to check would be16-20. Wait 16: product=2*4*8=64≠16. 17: prime.18:2*3*6*9=324≠18.19: prime.20: product=2*4*5*10=400≠20. So next nice number is21.\\n\\nAlright, that follows. Then next is 21,22 after.23 invalid, then 24,25,26.26 is nice. Then 27.27\\'s next. 28: Not.29,30,31, etc.33.\\n\\nSo that seems within the process.\\n\\nAlso, let me check if 3*9=27, so 3,9 are divisors of27, which is proper. Then59, so I confirm that 3 and9 are proper divisors, so yes, multiplying gives27. What’s9 is it considered as a proper divisor? Well a proper divisor is one excluding1 andN. So here,27: to check proper divisors.27\\'s divisors are1,3,9,27. So proper divisors are3,9. So product is3*9=27. Correct.\\n\\nSimilarly for33: divisors1,3,11,33. Proper divisors3 and11. Their product is33. Correct.\\n\\nHence, the first ten nice numbers are the listed ones. So sum is182.\\n\\nWait but Hold on. What about the number 28. All we saw:\\n\\nWait, 28 has divisors: 1,2,4,7,14,28. So proper divisors are2,4,7,14. Product of these is2*4*7*14=2*4=8, 8*7=56 (56*14=784 which is not28. So28 isn\\'t nice. Hence correct.\\n\\nWhat about something like numbers in between that might also meet? Maybe check numbers like 30; but as earlier checked, with multiple divisors. 30 also, would 2*3*5*6*10*15, product is surely way higher.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe numbers with few proper divisors.Knowing how nice numbers work, must equal product of their proper divisors.Therefore, to have such a product equal the number (N), implies that the product of those divisors is N. So N has a product of its proper divisors equal to itself.\\n\\nMathematically, formal:\\n\\nFor N, define the set D = {d | d is a proper divisor of N}, so D consists of the divisors d where 1 < d < N. Then the N = product of D.\\n\\nFor that product to be equal to N, we need that product(D) = N.\\n\\nSo, If we denote product(D) = N, this implies that the product of the proper divisors of N equals to N.\\n\\nBut product of D= N.\\n\\nThere\\'s a relation between the number and its divisors.\\n\\nNotice that for numbers which have exactly two proper divisors, multiplying them gives N. So numbers which have two proper divisors (excluding 1 and N), the product of those divisors must beN. So for N, if the number has proper divisorsd1andd2 whered1*d2= N. So numbers that have two proper divisors such that d1*d2 = N\\n\\nWhich would mean that these two divisors are composite in that way. For composite numbers in such a way.\\n\\nBut numbers with two proper divisors: for instance, prime numbers would have no proper divisors.\\n\\nBut composite numbers with exactly two proper divisors:\\n\\nThese would be composite numbers that have exactly two proper divisors. Let me think, a composite number and the number of divisors.\\n\\nSuppose if a number N has exactly two proper divisors. These would be numbers with three divisors (since total divisors:1, the two proper, andN itself), hence three in total. Which implies that N is a prime squared. Because primes squares have divisors:1, prime, and prime squared. For example: let p be prime. p² has divisors 1,p, p². Therefore, proper divisors are just p. So since only one proper divisor. Wait. Therefore, there would be in that case, only one proper divisor, but Requirement is N being the product of the proper divisors—If there is only one proper divisor, then the product would equal that divisor. So in that case, prime squares where product of its proper divisors (which is prime) would be p. But N is p², so p ≠ p². Hence prime squares are Not nice.\\n\\nBut wait if N=p* q, two distinct primes, then divisors would be 1, p, q, pq. So (1,p,q,N). Then, proper divisors arep and q. Then their product is p*q= N, hence such numbers should qualify. Those are probably semi-primes (numbers with two primes factors, as 6= 2*3, etc.)\\n\\nAh! So numbers that are the product of two distinct primes (semiprimes) would have exactly two proper divisors (the primes), and product gives the number itself. Therefore, semiprimes should qualify. That is numbers of the form p*q where p and q are distinct primes. Hence all such numbers are nice. Such numbers include 6,10,14,15,21,22,26, etc.\\n\\nBut what about numbers with more than two proper divisors? For example, let\\'s consider 8. Divisors 1,2,4,8. Proper divisors are 2,4. Product 2*4=8. So 8 is product of two factors. But is 8=2*4. However, 8 is not a semiprime since it\\'s 2³. But again 2 and4 are divisors, but 4 is multiple of2.\\n\\nSimilarly, number 16. Proper divisors: 2,4,8. Product is 2*4*8=64≠16. Not nice.\\n\\nSo, interesting, while semiprimes (products of two distinct primes) automatically have N=p*q whose proper divisors are p and q, so their product is p*q=N. Then, they meet the criteria. However, the number 8 is 2*4=8. But it seems 8 is also considered, how.\\n\\nWait, 8=2^3. Its divisors are1,2,4,8. Proper divisors are2,4. So 2,4 are the only proper divisors. 2+4=6, but irrelevant. The product is8; same as the number. So, but why 8 is nice when it’s. It is the product of its proper divisors. So even if the product is 2 and4.\\n\\nThat’s unique. So maybe numbers with two proper divisors, regardless whether both are prime or not. But wait, if they have two proper divisors and their product equals the number.\\n\\nSo if a number number has two proper divisors,d₁ andd₂, whered₁*d₂= N, then N is nice regardless.\\n\\nBut in 6, the proper divisors are2 and3, which are primes.\\n\\nIn 8, the proper divisors are2 and4, witho divisors.4 isn\\'t prim.\\n\\nBut wouldn\\'t the number N=8 requires d₁*d₂=8. So, for composite numbers with exact two proper divisors,d₁ and d₂, their product is equal to N. So, to figure which numbers have exactly two proper divisors.\\n\\nTo check for the count of proper divisors.\\n\\nA number N>1.\\n\\nIf the number of proper Divisors is two...\\n\\nFor a number to have exactly two proper divisors, the total divisors of N must have four elements (1, d₁,d₂,N),so N must have four divisors. Such numbers are called in mathematics as numbers with exactly four divisors.\\n\\nNumbers with exactly four divisors: known either as primes cubed (if cube of a prime) or products of two distinct primes— thin synonyms.\\n\\nNumber can either be p³ (which have divisors1, p, p², p³: but these\\'s proper divisors p and p², product p* p²= p³=N. Which gives product* proper divisors equals N. So, prime cubes would be anas similar method.\\n\\nSimilarly for primesquares but that was not; earlier thought.\\n\\nLet’s clarify. If N=p³, the divisors are 1, p, p², p³. Proper divisors= p and p². The product p*p²= p³= N. Hence such cube numbers also satisfy having exactly two proper divisors whose product equals N. Therefore, these cube primes as well as semiprimes would be \"nice\".\\n\\nThus, for N=p*q (semiprimes) and N=p³, these would qualify as nice numbers. Hence first, numbers with 4 divisors: which if they’re semiprimes (product of two primes) or prime cubes.\\n\\nHence for N=6=2*3, is semiprimes, cube numbers for instance,8=2³, as cube. Then, semiprimes would be have 4 divisors (1 and then the two primes and themselves. So prime cubes and semiprimes have four divisors.\\n\\nHence, pr³ and pq are two types of numbers with four divisors, each.\\n\\nAnother example: 27=3³. It\\'s cube. Divisors:1,3,9,27. proper divisors are3,9. Product 3*9=27=N. So27 is nice. So numbers prime cubes and semiprimes are both nice.\\n\\nWhich explains why 6,8,10,14,15,21,22,26,27,33 are first ten. Since they could be semiprimes and primes cubes.\\n\\nNow assuming this, the first ten nice numbers will be composed of numbers with 4 divisors which is either the product of two distinct primes (semiprimes) or a cube of a prime. So both categories. Therefore, the nice numbers include those.\\n\\nLet thus list them. Initial semiprimes are ordered in ascending order: starting from the smallest. Then cubes as of primes.\\n\\nCube primes:\\n\\nThe smallest cube is2³=8.\\n\\nThen3³=27,\\n\\n5³=125, which is large. 125 may come later.\\n\\nNumbers like 8,27, p³, etc.\\n\\nSemiprimes:\\n\\nThe semiprimes are numbers like6=2×3,\\n\\n10=2×5,\\n\\n14=2×7,\\n\\n15=3×5,\\n\\n21=3×7,\\n\\n22=2×11,\\n\\n26=2×13,\\n\\n33=3×11,\\n\\nAnd so on.\\n\\nHence, when arranged in ascending order, combining both semiprimes and primes-cubes: this yields the numbers 6,8,10,14,15,21,22,26,27,33...\\n\\nLet me check that order:\\n\\nOrganize numbers accordingly:\\n\\nSemiprimes:\\n\\n6,10,14,15,21,22,26,34,38,....\\n\\nPrimes cubes:8,27,125,... etc\\n\\nSo let\\'s list combined order:\\n\\nMinimum start with:\\n\\n6 (smallest semiprime),\\n\\n8 (smallest prime cube),\\n\\n10 (next semiprime),\\n\\n14,\\n\\n15,\\n\\n21,\\n\\n22,\\n\\n26,\\n\\n27 (3³),\\n\\n33 (next semiprime is3×11=33?), coming next.

      "{'question': \"Consider a string of $n$ $7$ 's, $7777\\\\cdots77,$ into which $+$ signs are inserted to produce an arithmetic expression. For example, $7+77+777+7+7=875$ could be obtained from eight $7$ 's in this way. For how many values of $n$ is it possible to insert $+$ signs so that the resulting expression has value $7000$ ?\", 'solution': 'Alright, so I need to figure out for how many values of n (where n is the number of 7\\'s in a string) it\\'s possible to insert plus signs between them to form an arithmetic expression that sums up to 7000. The example given uses eight 7\\'s to make 875, so the task is similar but with 7000 as the target. Let me start by understanding the problem better.\\n\\nFirst, each \\'+\\' sign breaks the string of 7\\'s into separate numbers. These numbers can be of varying lengths: 7, 77, 777, etc., up to the maximum length n. Each of these numbers is composed solely of 7\\'s. So, for example, if n=3, the possible numbers are 7, 77, 777. If n=4, you can have 7, 77, 777, 7777, and so on.\\n\\nThe key here is to figure out all possible values of n where such a combination of these numbers adds up to 7000. Since n can vary, we need to determine for which n this is possible.\\n\\nLet me start by considering the properties of numbers made up of all 7\\'s. Let\\'s denote a number with k 7\\'s as S_k. So, S_1 = 7, S_2 = 77, S_3 = 777, etc. Each S_k can be expressed as 7*(10^{k-1} + 10^{k-2} + ... + 10^0) = 7*( (10^k - 1)/9 ). For example, S_2 = 7*( (10^2 - 1)/9 ) = 7*11 = 77.\\n\\nSo, each term in the sum is of the form 7*( (10^k - 1)/9 ). Therefore, the total sum of these terms would be 7*( sum_{k} ( (10^{k_i} - 1)/9 ) ), where k_i are the lengths of the numbers used. Let\\'s denote this sum as 7/9 * sum_{k} (10^{k_i} - 1). \\n\\nBut the total sum we need is 7000. So:\\n\\n7/9 * sum_{k} (10^{k_i} - 1) = 7000\\n\\nMultiplying both sides by 9/7:\\n\\nsum_{k} (10^{k_i} - 1) = 7000 * 9 / 7 = 9000\\n\\nSo, sum_{k} (10^{k_i} - 1) = 9000\\n\\nBut 10^{k_i} - 1 is a number consisting of k_i 9\\'s. For example, 10^3 -1 = 999. Therefore, the sum becomes sum_{k} (9...9) where each term has k_i digits. So, each term is a multiple of 9, and their sum is 9000, which is also a multiple of 9. That checks out.\\n\\nBut perhaps another way to look at this is to note that each term S_k = 7...7 (k times) can be written as 7 * (1 + 10 + 10^2 + ... + 10^{k-1}). Therefore, when you sum multiple S_k terms, the total sum would be 7 * sum_{terms} (1 + 10 + 10^2 + ... + 10^{k_i - 1}).\\n\\nBut maybe this complicates things. Let me think.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe it\\'s easier to model the problem in terms of the number of terms and their lengths. Each \\'+\\' inserted splits the string into a new term. So, for example, inserting a \\'+\\' after the first 7 gives 7 + ... and the rest is a similar problem with n-1 7\\'s. But recursion might not be straightforward here.\\n\\nAlternatively, since 7000 is the target, and each term is a multiple of 7, we can factor out 7. Let\\'s see:\\n\\nEach term S_k is 7 * ( (10^k - 1)/9 ). Therefore, the total sum is 7 * sum_{k} ( (10^k - 1)/9 ). So, 7 * [sum terms] = 7000 => [sum terms] = 1000. Therefore, the problem reduces to finding the number of 7\\'s needed such that the sum of terms (each term being (10^{k_i} - 1)/9 ) equals 1000.\\n\\nWait, that might be a better way to think. Let\\'s define T_k = (10^k - 1)/9. Then, each T_k is 1, 11, 111, 1111, etc. So, the problem is equivalent to finding how many values of n allow us to write 1000 as a sum of T_k\\'s, where each T_k corresponds to a segment of k 7\\'s in the original problem (since each k 7\\'s contribute 7*T_k to the sum). Therefore, since we factored out the 7, the sum of the T_k\\'s must be 1000.\\n\\nSo, the problem reduces to: how many n can we partition into segments (each of length at least 1) such that the sum of T_k for each segment is 1000, where T_k is 1, 11, 111, etc.\\n\\nTherefore, n is the total number of digits used in all the T_k terms. Each T_k has k digits (in terms of 1\\'s, but in our original problem, each T_k corresponds to k 7\\'s). Therefore, n is the sum of the lengths of each term in the T_k decomposition. So, we need to find all possible n such that there exists a set of numbers k_1, k_2, ..., k_m where each k_i >= 1, sum_{i=1 to m} T_{k_i} = 1000, and n = sum_{i=1 to m} k_i.\\n\\nTherefore, the problem is equivalent to expressing 1000 as a sum of numbers of the form T_k (1, 11, 111, ...), and then finding all possible total lengths n (sum of k\\'s) for such expressions. Then, the answer is the number of distinct n\\'s possible.\\n\\nTherefore, the key is to find all possible combinations of T_k terms that sum to 1000 and compute the corresponding n for each combination, then count how many distinct n\\'s there are.\\n\\nSo, the next step is to figure out all possible combinations of T_k that sum to 1000. Let\\'s note that T_1=1, T_2=11, T_3=111, T_4=1111, T_5=11111, etc.\\n\\nBut 11111 is 11111 which is already 11111, and since 1000 is our target, the maximum possible T_k we can use is T_4=1111, because T_5=11111 is larger than 1000. Wait, 1111 is 1111, which is 1111, which is 1111. Let me check: T_1=1, T_2=11, T_3=111, T_4=1111, T_5=11111. So, T_4=1111 is 1111, which is 1111. 1111 is greater than 1000? No, 1111 is 1111, which is more than 1000. Wait, 1000 is 1000, so T_4=1111 is 1111, which is 1111. So 1111 is greater than 1000. Therefore, the maximum possible T_k we can use is T_3=111, since T_4 is already larger than 1000. Wait, 111 is 111, which is 111. Then T_4=1111=1111, which is 1111, which is 1111. So 1111 is larger than 1000, so we can\\'t use T_4 or higher. Therefore, the possible terms we can use are T_1=1, T_2=11, T_3=111. Therefore, the problem reduces to expressing 1000 as a sum of 1\\'s, 11\\'s, and 111\\'s, and then for each such expression, sum the number of digits (i.e., the number of terms: each T_1 contributes 1 digit, T_2 contributes 2 digits, etc.) and find the number of distinct total digits n.\\n\\nTherefore, the problem becomes equivalent to solving:\\n\\nFind all non-negative integers a, b, c such that:\\n\\na*1 + b*11 + c*111 = 1000\\n\\nand then compute n = a*1 + b*2 + c*3 for each solution (a, b, c), and find the number of distinct n\\'s.\\n\\nTherefore, the problem reduces to solving the above Diophantine equation and then counting the distinct n\\'s.\\n\\nSo, first, we need to find all triples (a, b, c) of non-negative integers satisfying:\\n\\na + 11b + 111c = 1000\\n\\nThen, for each such triple, compute n = a + 2b + 3c, and count how many different n\\'s there are.\\n\\nSo, let\\'s try to solve the equation a + 11b + 111c = 1000.\\n\\nWe can approach this by considering the possible values of c, since 111c is the largest term. Let\\'s find the possible values of c first.\\n\\nThe maximum possible c is floor(1000 / 111) = floor(9.009) = 9. So c can be from 0 to 9.\\n\\nFor each c in 0 to 9, we can compute the remaining sum 1000 - 111c, and then solve a + 11b = remaining_sum, where remaining_sum must be non-negative.\\n\\nThen, for each c, we can solve for b and a:\\n\\nremaining_sum = 1000 - 111c\\n\\nThen, a = remaining_sum - 11b\\n\\nSince a must be non-negative, we have remaining_sum - 11b >= 0 => b <= remaining_sum / 11\\n\\nTherefore, for each c, the possible values of b are from 0 to floor(remaining_sum / 11), and for each such b, a is determined as remaining_sum - 11b.\\n\\nTherefore, for each c from 0 to 9, we can compute the possible (a, b) pairs, then compute n = a + 2b + 3c, and collect all distinct n\\'s.\\n\\nThis seems manageable. Let\\'s proceed step by step.\\n\\nFirst, list c from 0 to 9, compute remaining_sum = 1000 - 111c, then for each remaining_sum, find possible b\\'s (from 0 to floor(remaining_sum / 11)), then compute a and n.\\n\\nBut doing this manually for each c from 0 to 9 would be time-consuming, but perhaps we can find a pattern or formula.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe we can parameterize in terms of c and find expressions for n.\\n\\nNote that n = a + 2b + 3c\\n\\nBut since a = remaining_sum - 11b, then:\\n\\nn = (remaining_sum - 11b) + 2b + 3c = remaining_sum - 9b + 3c\\n\\nBut remaining_sum = 1000 - 111c\\n\\nTherefore,\\n\\nn = (1000 - 111c) - 9b + 3c = 1000 - 111c -9b +3c = 1000 - 108c -9b\\n\\nSo, n = 1000 - 9*(12c + b)\\n\\nTherefore, for each c, and for each b in 0 <= b <= floor((1000 - 111c)/11), n can be expressed as 1000 - 9*(12c + b)\\n\\nTherefore, the possible n\\'s are 1000 - 9k, where k = 12c + b, and such that 111c +11b <=1000 (since remaining_sum =1000 -111c =11b +a >=11b)\\n\\nBut we need to find all possible k such that 12c + b =k, with c >=0, b >=0, and 111c +11b <=1000. Then n=1000 -9k.\\n\\nTherefore, the problem reduces to finding all integers k such that there exist non-negative integers c and b where k =12c + b and 111c +11b <=1000, and then n=1000 -9k. Then, the answer is the number of distinct n\\'s, which is equivalent to the number of distinct k\\'s.\\n\\nAlternatively, since n=1000 -9k, each distinct k corresponds to a distinct n. Therefore, the number of distinct n\\'s is equal to the number of distinct k\\'s. So, we need to find the number of distinct k=12c +b where c >=0, b>=0, and 111c +11b <=1000.\\n\\nBut perhaps this approach is not straightforward. Let\\'s consider again solving for each c from 0 to 9:\\n\\nCase c=0:\\n\\nremaining_sum =1000 -0=1000\\n\\nThen, b can range from 0 to floor(1000/11)=90 (since 11*91=1001>1000)\\n\\nSo, b=0 to 90\\n\\nThus, k=12*0 +b=0 +b= b, so k ranges from 0 to90\\n\\nTherefore, n=1000 -9k, where k=0,...,90, so n ranges from 1000 -0=1000 down to 1000 -9*90=1000 -810=190\\n\\nBut these are possible n\\'s when c=0. However, we need to consider that when c increases, k=12c +b, so k increases, which would decrease n.\\n\\nBut when c increases, the maximum possible b decreases.\\n\\nWait, for c=0, k can be 0 to90, for c=1, remaining_sum=1000 -111=889\\n\\nThen, b can be from 0 to floor(889/11)=80 (11*81=891>889)\\n\\nThus, k=12*1 +b=12 +b, where b=0 to80, so k=12 to12+80=92\\n\\nSimilarly, for c=2, remaining_sum=1000 -222=778\\n\\nb=0 to floor(778/11)=70 (11*71=781>778)\\n\\nk=12*2 +b=24 +b, b=0 to70, so k=24 to24+70=94\\n\\nSimilarly, for c=3:\\n\\nremaining_sum=1000 -333=667\\n\\nb=0 to floor(667/11)=60 (11*61=671>667)\\n\\nk=12*3 +b=36 +b, so k=36 to36+60=96\\n\\nc=4:\\n\\nremaining_sum=1000 -444=556\\n\\nb=0 to floor(556/11)=50 (11*51=561>556)\\n\\nk=48 +b, b=0 to50, so k=48 to98\\n\\nc=5:\\n\\nremaining_sum=1000 -555=445\\n\\nb=0 to floor(445/11)=40 (11*41=451>445)\\n\\nk=60 +b, b=0 to40, k=60 to100\\n\\nc=6:\\n\\nremaining_sum=1000 -666=334\\n\\nb=0 to floor(334/11)=30 (11*31=341>334)\\n\\nk=72 +b, b=0 to30, k=72 to102\\n\\nc=7:\\n\\nremaining_sum=1000 -777=223\\n\\nb=0 to floor(223/11)=20 (11*21=231>223)\\n\\nk=84 +b, b=0 to20, k=84 to104\\n\\nc=8:\\n\\nremaining_sum=1000 -888=112\\n\\nb=0 to floor(112/11)=10 (11*11=121>112)\\n\\nk=96 +b, b=0 to10, k=96 to106\\n\\nc=9:\\n\\nremaining_sum=1000 -999=1\\n\\nb=0 to floor(1/11)=0\\n\\nSo, only b=0\\n\\nk=108 +0=108\\n\\nTherefore, k ranges for each c:\\n\\nc=0: 0-90\\n\\nc=1:12-92\\n\\nc=2:24-94\\n\\nc=3:36-96\\n\\nc=4:48-98\\n\\nc=5:60-100\\n\\nc=6:72-102\\n\\nc=7:84-104\\n\\nc=8:96-106\\n\\nc=9:108\\n\\nSo, now we need to see all possible k\\'s covered by these intervals. Let\\'s list the ranges:\\n\\n0-90 (c=0)\\n\\n12-92 (c=1)\\n\\n24-94 (c=2)\\n\\n36-96 (c=3)\\n\\n48-98 (c=4)\\n\\n60-100 (c=5)\\n\\n72-102 (c=6)\\n\\n84-104 (c=7)\\n\\n96-106 (c=8)\\n\\n108 (c=9)\\n\\nNow, let\\'s see the overlapping of these ranges.\\n\\nStarting from c=0: 0-90\\n\\nThen c=1 starts at 12, so from 12-90 is overlapping, then 91-92.\\n\\nc=2 starts at24, overlaps with c=0\\'s upper part? No, c=0 goes up to90, c=2 starts at24. Wait, but c=0\\'s k is 0-90, c=1\\'s k is12-92. So from12-90 is overlapping between c=0 and c=1.\\n\\nSimilarly, c=2\\'s k is24-94, which overlaps with c=1\\'s k up to92. So 24-92 overlaps with c=1, and 93-94 is new.\\n\\nSimilarly, c=3\\'s k=36-96 overlaps with previous ranges up to94. So 36-94 overlaps, 95-96 is new.\\n\\nc=4:48-98 overlaps up to96 (from c=3), then 97-98 is new.\\n\\nc=5:60-100 overlaps up to98 (from c=4), then 99-100 is new.\\n\\nc=6:72-102 overlaps up to100 (from c=5), then 101-102 is new.\\n\\nc=7:84-104 overlaps up to102 (from c=6), then 103-104 is new.\\n\\nc=8:96-106 overlaps up to104 (from c=7), then 105-106 is new.\\n\\nc=9:108.\\n\\nSo, compiling all the k ranges:\\n\\nFrom c=0:0-90\\n\\nc=1:12-92 → new parts:91-92\\n\\nc=2:24-94 → new parts:93-94\\n\\nc=3:36-96 → new parts:95-96\\n\\nc=4:48-98 → new parts:97-98\\n\\nc=5:60-100 → new parts:99-100\\n\\nc=6:72-102 → new parts:101-102\\n\\nc=7:84-104 → new parts:103-104\\n\\nc=8:96-106 → new parts:105-106\\n\\nc=9:108\\n\\nTherefore, the total k values are:\\n\\n0-90, 91-92,93-94,95-96,97-98,99-100,101-102,103-104,105-106,108.\\n\\nSo, combining these:\\n\\n0-90, 91-106, and 108.\\n\\nBut note that 91-92 is included in c=1\\'s upper range, then c=2 adds 93-94, c=3 adds 95-96, etc., up to c=8 adding 105-106. Then c=9 adds 108.\\n\\nTherefore, the entire range of k is:\\n\\nFrom 0 to106, except for gaps between90 and91? Wait, c=0 gives 0-90, then c=1 gives12-92, so between0-90 and12-92, so from0-92 is covered except 91-92 are only from c=1. Wait, no, c=0\\'s k=0-90, c=1\\'s k=12-92. So, 12-90 is overlapping. So, k=0-11 is only from c=0 (since c=1 starts at12). Then, from12-90, both c=0 and c=1 contribute. Then, from91-92, only c=1. Then, c=2 adds24-94, but 24-94 overlaps with previous ranges. Specifically, from24-90: overlapping with c=0 and c=1. From91-94: covered by c=1 and c=2. Wait, this is getting confusing.\\n\\nAlternatively, let\\'s think of the union of all k ranges:\\n\\nStart with c=0:0-90\\n\\nThen c=1 adds12-92, which extends the upper bound from90 to92\\n\\nc=2 adds24-94, extending upper bound to94\\n\\nc=3 adds36-96, extending to96\\n\\nc=4 adds48-98, extending to98\\n\\nc=5 adds60-100, extending to100\\n\\nc=6 adds72-102, extending to102\\n\\nc=7 adds84-104, extending to104\\n\\nc=8 adds96-106, extending to106\\n\\nc=9 adds108\\n\\nBut also, each c adds a new upper part beyond the previous maximum.\\n\\nSo the overall k ranges are:\\n\\n0-90 (from c=0)\\n\\nplus 91-92 (from c=1)\\n\\nplus 93-94 (from c=2)\\n\\nplus 95-96 (from c=3)\\n\\nplus 97-98 (from c=4)\\n\\nplus 99-100 (from c=5)\\n\\nplus 101-102 (from c=6)\\n\\nplus 103-104 (from c=7)\\n\\nplus 105-106 (from c=8)\\n\\nplus 108 (from c=9)\\n\\nSo, the total k\\'s are from0-90,91-92,93-94,95-96,97-98,99-100,101-102,103-104,105-106,108.\\n\\nThus, the maximum k is108, and the minimum is0. But note that between these ranges, there are gaps?\\n\\nWait, from0-90, then91-92, then93-94, etc., up to106, then jump to108. So, the missing k\\'s are107 and109 onwards, but109 onwards are beyond our consideration.\\n\\nBut in reality, k=107 is not achieved, since the next after106 is108. So, the k\\'s covered are:\\n\\n0-90 (all integers)\\n\\n91-92 (integers91,92)\\n\\n93-94 (93,94)\\n\\n95-96 (95,96)\\n\\n97-98 (97,98)\\n\\n99-100 (99,100)\\n\\n101-102 (101,102)\\n\\n103-104 (103,104)\\n\\n105-106 (105,106)\\n\\n108.\\n\\nTherefore, the total k\\'s are:\\n\\nAll integers from0 to90 inclusive,\\n\\nPlus 91,92,93,94,95,96,97,98,99,100,101,102,103,104,105,106,108.\\n\\nTherefore, the total number of distinct k\\'s is:\\n\\n91 (from0-90) +17 (from91-106) +1 (108) =91+17+1=109. Wait, but let\\'s check:\\n\\nFrom0-90:91 numbers\\n\\nFrom91-106:16 numbers (91,92,...,106). Wait, 106-91+1=16.\\n\\nWait, 91 to106 inclusive is16 numbers. Then 108 is1 number.\\n\\nTotal:91+16+1=108. But wait:\\n\\nWait, 0-90:91 numbers.\\n\\n91-106:16 numbers (since 106-91=15, plus1=16)\\n\\nThen108:1 number.\\n\\nTotal:91+16+1=108.\\n\\nBut wait, but when we broke down the ranges, after0-90, the next ranges are:\\n\\n91-92:2 numbers\\n\\n93-94:2\\n\\n95-96:2\\n\\n97-98:2\\n\\n99-100:2\\n\\n101-102:2\\n\\n103-104:2\\n\\n105-106:2\\n\\nSo that\\'s 8 ranges with2 each:8*2=16\\n\\nThen108:1\\n\\nTotal:91+16+1=108.\\n\\nBut wait, but the numbers from91-106 inclusive are16 numbers (91 to106). Therefore, the total k\\'s are0-90 (91 numbers),91-106 (16 numbers), and108 (1 number). So total distinct k\\'s=91+16+1=108. But wait, 91+16=107, plus1=108.\\n\\nHowever, when I listed the ranges earlier, I had:\\n\\nFrom c=0:0-90\\n\\nFrom c=1:12-92 (which adds91-92)\\n\\nFrom c=2:24-94 (adds93-94)\\n\\nFrom c=3:36-96 (adds95-96)\\n\\nFrom c=4:48-98 (adds97-98)\\n\\nFrom c=5:60-100 (adds99-100)\\n\\nFrom c=6:72-102 (adds101-102)\\n\\nFrom c=7:84-104 (adds103-104)\\n\\nFrom c=8:96-106 (adds105-106)\\n\\nFrom c=9:108\\n\\nSo, each c>=1 adds two new k\\'s except c=9 which adds one. But actually, each c from1-8 adds two new k\\'s (since each c\\'s upper range is two more than the previous upper range), and c=9 adds108. Let\\'s check:\\n\\nc=1: adds91-92 (2 numbers)\\n\\nc=2: adds93-94 (2)\\n\\nc=3:95-96 (2)\\n\\nc=4:97-98 (2)\\n\\nc=5:99-100 (2)\\n\\nc=6:101-102 (2)\\n\\nc=7:103-104 (2)\\n\\nc=8:105-106 (2)\\n\\nc=9:108 (1)\\n\\nTotal added by c=1-9: 8*2 +1=17\\n\\nSo, total k\\'s: original0-90 (91) +17=108. Therefore, the total number of distinct k\\'s is108, which would correspond to108 distinct n\\'s. However, we need to verify this because there might be overlaps in n\\'s from different c\\'s.\\n\\nWait, but wait, n=1000-9k. Each distinct k gives a distinct n because if k1 !=k2, then 1000-9k1 !=1000-9k2. Since 9 is a factor, unless k1 and k2 differ by a multiple of something. Wait, no, 9*(k1 -k2) would be the difference. Therefore, unless k1=k2, n\\'s are distinct. Therefore, since all k\\'s are distinct, all n\\'s are distinct. Therefore, the number of distinct n\\'s is equal to the number of distinct k\\'s, which is108.\\n\\nBut wait, this seems high. Let\\'s verify with an example. For c=0, k ranges from0-90, so n=1000-9*0=1000 down to1000-9*90=190. Then for c=1, k ranges from12-92, so n=1000-108=892 down to1000-9*92=1000-828=172. But wait, some of these n\\'s may overlap with n\\'s from c=0. For instance, if a k in c=0 and a k in c=1 result in the same n. But since n=1000-9k, if k1 !=k2, then n1 !=n2. Therefore, since all k\\'s across different c\\'s are unique, the n\\'s are unique. Therefore, each k from0-90,91-106,108 gives a unique n.\\n\\nBut wait, hold on. For c=0, k=12 would correspond to n=1000-108=892. For c=1, k=12 is part of the range12-92. Wait, but c=0 and c=1 can have the same k? Wait no, when c=0, k=0-90, when c=1, k=12-92. So, overlapping k\\'s between c=0 and c=1 are12-90. Therefore, k=12 is present in both c=0 and c=1. Wait, but if k=12 can be achieved by both c=0 and c=1, but with different n\\'s? No, wait, n=1000-9k, so if k is the same, n is the same, regardless of how you achieve k. Therefore, even if k=12 is achieved by different c\\'s, n would be the same. Therefore, we might have overlapping n\\'s even if the k\\'s are from different c\\'s.\\n\\nWait, this is a problem. Earlier reasoning assumed that each k is unique, but actually, k can be achieved through different combinations of c and b. Therefore, different (c,b) pairs can result in the same k, leading to the same n. Therefore, the total number of distinct n\\'s may be less than108.\\n\\nThis complicates things. Therefore, the previous assumption was wrong. We need to check if different (c,b) pairs can lead to the same k, and hence the same n. Therefore, the count of distinct n\\'s is not simply the count of k\\'s, but the count of distinct k\\'s considering overlaps.\\n\\nTherefore, we need to check for overlaps in k across different c\\'s. For example, can a k value be achieved by more than one (c, b) pair?\\n\\nLet\\'s take an example. Let\\'s consider k=12.\\n\\nFrom c=0: To get k=12, we need b=12, but in c=0, remaining_sum=1000. So, a=1000 -11*12=1000 -132=868. So, possible. Therefore, k=12 can be achieved by c=0, b=12.\\n\\nFrom c=1: k=12 can be achieved by c=1, b=0. Since k=12c +b =>12*1 +0=12. Therefore, k=12 can be achieved by both c=0, b=12 and c=1, b=0. Therefore, the same k is achieved by two different pairs, leading to the same n=1000 -9*12=1000-108=892. Therefore, even though k=12 is counted in both c=0 and c=1, it\\'s the same n. Therefore, n=892 is counted only once.\\n\\nSimilarly, for other k\\'s that can be achieved by multiple (c, b) pairs, they would not contribute to multiple n\\'s. Therefore, the number of distinct n\\'s is equal to the number of distinct k\\'s, regardless of how many times a k is achieved.\\n\\nBut wait, but in our earlier breakdown, we had overlapping k\\'s. For example, k=24 can be achieved by c=0, b=24 and c=2, b=0. Similarly, k=12 can be achieved by c=0, b=12 and c=1, b=0. So, k\\'s in overlapping ranges correspond to the same n\\'s. Therefore, even though when we calculated the total k\\'s as0-90,91-92,...108, in reality, some k\\'s in the lower ranges (like12-90) are already included in the higher c\\'s. Wait, no, actually, in our initial breakdown, we considered each c\\'s k range as:\\n\\nFor c=0:0-90\\n\\nFor c=1:12-92\\n\\nFor c=2:24-94\\n\\nEtc.\\n\\nBut in reality, the k\\'s in c=1 (12-92) overlap with c=0\\'s k\\'s from12-90. However, in reality, these overlapping k\\'s correspond to different (c, b) pairs but the same k. Therefore, when we take the union of all k\\'s, we need to consider that some k\\'s are already covered by lower c\\'s.\\n\\nWait, but in our initial analysis, we thought of the union of k ranges as0-90, then adding91-92, etc. However, this approach is incorrect because the k\\'s from12-90 in c=1 are already included in c=0\\'s k\\'s. Therefore, when taking the union, the total distinct k\\'s are not simply0-90 plus the additional ranges, but actually:\\n\\nThe minimum k for each c increases as c increases. For example, for c=1, the minimum k is12, for c=2, it\\'s24, etc. So, the k\\'s for each subsequent c start at12c and go up. Therefore, the k\\'s for c=0 are0-90, for c=1 are12-92, for c=2 are24-94, etc., each shifted by12. Therefore, the union of all k\\'s is0-106 and108, but with some gaps.\\n\\nWait, but in reality, for c=0, k=0-90 (in steps of1, since b can be any integer from0-90). For c=1, k=12-92 (since b can be0-80, so12+0=12 to12+80=92). Similarly, c=2:24-94 (24+0=24 to24+70=94). So, each subsequent c\\'s k starts at12c and ends at12c + floor((1000 -111c)/11). Therefore, the k\\'s for each c are intervals starting at12c and extending upwards.\\n\\nTherefore, the union of all these k intervals would be:\\n\\nFor c=0:0-90\\n\\nFor c=1:12-92\\n\\nFor c=2:24-94\\n\\nFor c=3:36-96\\n\\nFor c=4:48-98\\n\\nFor c=5:60-100\\n\\nFor c=6:72-102\\n\\nFor c=7:84-104\\n\\nFor c=8:96-106\\n\\nFor c=9:108\\n\\nTherefore, combining these intervals:\\n\\nStarting from0-90, then12-92 overlaps partially, extending the upper limit to92, then24-94 extends to94, etc. But actually, each subsequent interval starts higher but may extend beyond the previous upper limit.\\n\\nHowever, when combined, the overall k values covered are:\\n\\nFrom0 up to106, but not all integers in this range are covered. For example, k=1 is covered by c=0, k=11 is covered by c=0, but k=12 is covered by both c=0 and c=1.\\n\\nBut wait, no, k=12 can be achieved by c=0 (with b=12) and c=1 (with b=0). So, k=12 is covered in both c=0 and c=1. Therefore, all k\\'s from0-90 are covered by c=0, then k\\'s from12-92 are covered by c=1, which includes k=12-90 (already covered by c=0) and adds k=91-92. Then c=2 adds24-94, which includes24-90 (already covered) and adds91-94. Wait, no:\\n\\nWait, when c=1, remaining_sum=889, b=0 to80, so k=12*1 +b=12 to92. Therefore, k=12-92.\\n\\nSimilarly, c=2: remaining_sum=778, b=0-70, so k=24 to94.\\n\\nTherefore, the overlap between c=1 and c=2 is24-92.\\n\\nBut c=0 already covers0-90, so c=1 covers12-92, which overlaps with c=0 in12-90, and adds91-92. Then c=2 covers24-94, overlapping with c=1 in24-92, and adds93-94. So, the union after c=0,1,2 is0-94.\\n\\nContinuing:\\n\\nc=3:36-96, overlapping with previous up to94, adding95-96.\\n\\nc=4:48-98, overlapping up to96, adding97-98.\\n\\nc=5:60-100, overlapping up to98, adding99-100.\\n\\nc=6:72-102, overlapping up to100, adding101-102.\\n\\nc=7:84-104, overlapping up to102, adding103-104.\\n\\nc=8:96-106, overlapping up to104, adding105-106.\\n\\nc=9:108.\\n\\nThus, combining all c\\'s, the total k\\'s covered are:\\n\\n0-94 (from c=0-2), then95-96 (c=3),97-98 (c=4),99-100 (c=5),101-102 (c=6),103-104 (c=7),105-106 (c=8), and108 (c=9). So the total covered k\\'s are0-94,95-96,97-98,99-100,101-102,103-104,105-106,108.\\n\\nTherefore, the missing k\\'s are107 and any above108, but108 is covered. So, missing k\\'s are107.\\n\\nThus, the total distinct k\\'s are:\\n\\nNumbers from0-106, except107, plus108. So total numbers:107 -0 +1 =108 numbers, minus1 missing (107) plus1 (108) gives108.\\n\\nWait, from0-106 inclusive, that\\'s107 numbers. But we are missing107, so we have106 numbers from0-106 excluding107, plus108: total106+1=107.\\n\\nBut wait, no:\\n\\nIf the covered k\\'s are0-106 except107, and108, then total distinct k\\'s are(106 -0 +1) -1 +1=107-1+1=107. Wait, but how?\\n\\nWait, from0-106 inclusive:107 numbers. Excluding107:106 numbers. Adding108:107 total numbers. Therefore, the total number of distinct k\\'s is107. Therefore, the number of distinct n\\'s is107. However, let\\'s verify this.\\n\\nAlternatively, if we consider the union:\\n\\nFrom c=0:0-90 (91 numbers)\\n\\nc=1 adds91-92 (2 numbers)\\n\\nc=2 adds93-94 (2)\\n\\nc=3 adds95-96 (2)\\n\\nc=4 adds97-98 (2)\\n\\nc=5 adds99-100 (2)\\n\\nc=6 adds101-102 (2)\\n\\nc=7 adds103-104 (2)\\n\\nc=8 adds105-106 (2)\\n\\nc=9 adds108 (1)\\n\\nTotal numbers:91 + (2*8) +1=91+16+1=108. But earlier we thought there\\'s a missing k=107. Where is the discrepancy?\\n\\nThe key is whether the intervals as per each c include all numbers in their ranges or not.\\n\\nFor example, when c=8, k=96-106. But k=96 can be achieved by c=8 with b=0 (since k=12*8 +0=96). But k=96 was already achievable by c=3 (k=36 +60=96). Wait, no, c=3\\'s k=36 +b, where b ranges0-60. So, k=36 +b, b=0-60 gives k=36-96. Therefore, k=96 is achievable by c=3 (with b=60) and c=8 (with b=0). Therefore, k=96 is included in both c=3 and c=8. Therefore, when we take the union, k=96 is already included in c=3\\'s range. Therefore, the k\\'s added by c=8 are105-106 (since c=8\\'s k starts at96, but96-104 are already covered by previous c\\'s). Therefore, c=8 adds105-106.\\n\\nSimilarly, c=7 adds103-104, which are not covered by previous c\\'s.\\n\\nSimilarly, c=6 adds101-102, which are new.\\n\\nBut in this case, the k ranges as per each c add new numbers beyond the previous maximum. Therefore, the total k\\'s covered are0-90 (from c=0), then each subsequent c adds2 new k\\'s up to106, then108.\\n\\nBut k=107 is not covered by any c. Because c=8\\'s maximum k is106, and c=9\\'s k is108. So,107 is missing.\\n\\nTherefore, total distinct k\\'s are:\\n\\nFrom0-90:91\\n\\nFrom91-106:16 (since91-106 is16 numbers)\\n\\nPlus108:1\\n\\nTotal:91+16+1=108. However,91+16=107, plus1=108. But 91-106 is16 numbers, but91-106 inclusive is16 numbers (106-91+1=16). So, adding these to0-90 (91) gives107, plus108=108.\\n\\nBut k=107 is not covered. So, the total distinct k\\'s are0-106 except107, plus108. So that\\'s107-1+1=107? Wait, no:\\n\\nFrom0-106 inclusive, that\\'s107 numbers. But we are missing107, so it\\'s106 numbers. Then adding108 gives107 total numbers.\\n\\nBut earlier calculation said108. Contradiction.\\n\\nWait, I think the confusion comes from whether the ranges are inclusive or how they overlap. Let me count the numbers carefully.\\n\\nFirst, for c=0: k=0-90 (91 numbers)\\n\\nFor c=1: k=12-92. But12-90 is79 numbers, and91-92 is2 numbers. So, c=1 adds91-92 (2 new k\\'s)\\n\\nFor c=2: k=24-94.24-92 is69 numbers, and93-94 is2 new k\\'s\\n\\nFor c=3: k=36-96.36-94 is59 numbers,95-96 is2 new k\\'s\\n\\nFor c=4: k=48-98.48-96 is49 numbers,97-98 is2 new k\\'s\\n\\nFor c=5: k=60-100.60-98 is39 numbers,99-100 is2 new k\\'s\\n\\nFor c=6: k=72-102.72-100 is29 numbers,101-102 is2 new k\\'s\\n\\nFor c=7: k=84-104.84-102 is19 numbers,103-104 is2 new k\\'s\\n\\nFor c=8: k=96-106.96-104 is9 numbers,105-106 is2 new k\\'s\\n\\nFor c=9: k=108 (1 new k)\\n\\nSo, total new k\\'s added by each c:\\n\\nc=0:91\\n\\nc=1:2\\n\\nc=2:2\\n\\nc=3:2\\n\\nc=4:2\\n\\nc=5:2\\n\\nc=6:2\\n\\nc=7:2\\n\\nc=8:2\\n\\nc=9:1\\n\\nTotal:91 +8*2 +1=91+16+1=108.\\n\\nTherefore, the total distinct k\\'s are108, including108. Therefore, k=107 is not covered, but according to this count, we have108 distinct k\\'s. But how?\\n\\nAh, because the k\\'s added by each c after c=0 are:\\n\\nc=1:91,92\\n\\nc=2:93,94\\n\\nc=3:95,96\\n\\nc=4:97,98\\n\\nc=5:99,100\\n\\nc=6:101,102\\n\\nc=7:103,104\\n\\nc=8:105,106\\n\\nc=9:108\\n\\nSo, these are16 new k\\'s (8 pairs of2 and1 single). So, adding to the91 from c=0, gives91+16+1=108.\\n\\nTherefore, k=107 is not included, so the total k\\'s are0-106 except107, plus108, totaling107 numbers. But according to the count above, it\\'s108. There\\'s a discrepancy here. The mistake is in the assumption that the ranges are non-overlapping. However, when considering c=8\\'s k=96-106, this includes k=96-106. However, k=96-104 were already partially covered by previous c\\'s. For example, k=96 was covered by c=3, c=4, etc., but in our counting, we considered that each c after c=0 only adds the new upper two k\\'s. However, in reality, for example, c=8\\'s k=96-106 includes k=96-106, but96-104 were already covered by earlier c\\'s (like c=3-7), so only105-106 are new. Similarly, c=7\\'s k=84-104 includes k=84-104, but84-102 were covered by c=6, so only103-104 are new.\\n\\nTherefore, the correct way is that each c adds two new k\\'s beyond the previous maximum. Therefore, starting from c=0 max k=90, then c=1 adds91-92 (new max=92), c=2 adds93-94 (new max=94), c=3 adds95-96 (new max=96), c=4 adds97-98 (new max=98), c=5 adds99-100 (new max=100), c=6 adds101-102 (new max=102), c=7 adds103-104 (new max=104), c=8 adds105-106 (new max=106), c=9 adds108.\\n\\nTherefore, each c from1-8 adds two new k\\'s, and c=9 adds one. Therefore, total new k\\'s added:8*2 +1=17. Original k\\'s from c=0:0-90 (91). Total k\\'s:91+17=108. Therefore, the total number of distinct k\\'s is108, including all from0-90 and the added ones up to108, but missing k=107. Wait, but where is k=107? It\\'s not covered by any c. Because c=8\\'s max k=106, and c=9\\'s k=108. So,107 is missing. Therefore, there\\'s a gap at107.\\n\\nBut according to the count, we have108 k\\'s, which would mean107 is included. But according to the above, it\\'s not. Therefore, there\\'s a mistake in the counting.\\n\\nWait, let\\'s list all k\\'s explicitly:\\n\\nFrom c=0:0,1,2,...,90 (91 numbers)\\n\\nFrom c=1:12,13,...,92 (81 numbers) but new ones are91,92 (2 numbers)\\n\\nFrom c=2:24,25,...,94 (71 numbers) but new ones are93,94 (2 numbers)\\n\\nFrom c=3:36,...,96 (61 numbers) but new ones are95,96 (2)\\n\\nFrom c=4:48,...,98 (51 numbers) new ones97,98 (2)\\n\\nFrom c=5:60,...,100 (41 numbers) new ones99,100 (2)\\n\\nFrom c=6:72,...,102 (31 numbers) new ones101,102 (2)\\n\\nFrom c=7:84,...,104 (21 numbers) new ones103,104 (2)\\n\\nFrom c=8:96,...,106 (11 numbers) new ones105,106 (2)\\n\\nFrom c=9:108 (1)\\n\\nBut the overlap means that many k\\'s in these ranges are already covered by lower c\\'s. For example, k=12 is in c=0 and c=1. Therefore, when taking the union, the total distinct k\\'s are not simply the sum of individual counts but the unique values.\\n\\nHowever, according to the previous breakdown, each subsequent c adds only two new k\\'s beyond the previous maximum. Therefore:\\n\\nStart with0-90 (91)\\n\\nThen add91-92 (2) → total93\\n\\nThen add93-94 (2) → total95\\n\\nThen add95-96 (2) → total97\\n\\nThen add97-98 (2) → total99\\n\\nThen add99-100 (2) → total101\\n\\nThen add101-102 (2) → total103\\n\\nThen add103-104 (2) → total105\\n\\nThen add105-106 (2) → total107\\n\\nThen add108 (1) → total108\\n\\nBut this way, each addition only adds two new numbers, so total numbers would be91 +2*8 +1=91+16+1=108.\\n\\nBut how does this cover up to106 and108 but miss107?\\n\\nWait, no. If after adding105-106, the next c adds108. So between106 and108, there\\'s107 missing. Therefore, the total k\\'s are0-106 except107, plus108. Therefore, total numbers:\\n\\nNumbers from0-106:107 numbers\\n\\nMinus1 (107) gives106\\n\\nPlus108 gives107.\\n\\nBut according to the count above, it\\'s108. So which is correct?\\n\\nActually, the error is in the assumption that each c adds two new k\\'s. In reality, for example:\\n\\nc=1 adds91-92 (2 new)\\n\\nc=2 adds93-94 (2 new)\\n\\n...\\n\\nc=8 adds105-106 (2 new)\\n\\nc=9 adds108 (1 new)\\n\\nSo total new k\\'s added after c=0:8*2 +1=17. Therefore, total k\\'s=91+17=108. Therefore, the k\\'s are0-90 (91) and91-108 (17). But since91-108 is18 numbers, but we only added17, there\\'s a discrepancy. Ah, because108 is one beyond106. Therefore, the added k\\'s are91-106 (16 numbers) and108 (1). So, total added:17. Therefore, total k\\'s=91+17=108.\\n\\nTherefore, even though107 is missing, the total count is108. Because in the range91-108, we have18 numbers, but we are missing107, so17 numbers. But according to the count, it\\'s17 added, which would make total108. Therefore, the conclusion is that there are108 distinct k\\'s, hence108 distinct n\\'s.\\n\\nBut this contradicts the earlier thought that107 is missing. The resolution is that the k\\'s are0-90 (91), plus91-106 (16), plus108 (1), totaling91+16+1=108. Therefore, k=107 is indeed missing, but the other k\\'s from0-106 except107 and108 are included. Therefore, total distinct k\\'s=108.\\n\\nBut wait,0-106 inclusive is107 numbers. Minus107 gives106, plus108 gives107. But according to the detailed count above, it\\'s108. There must be an error in this line of reasoning.\\n\\nPerhaps the confusion arises from whether the ranges overlap or not. The key is to realize that when we consider the union of all k\\'s, they form a continuous range from0-90, then jumps to91-92, then93-94, etc., up to106, then jumps to108. Therefore, the total number of k\\'s is:\\n\\nFrom0-90:91\\n\\nFrom91-92:2\\n\\nFrom93-94:2\\n\\nFrom95-96:2\\n\\nFrom97-98:2\\n\\nFrom99-100:2\\n\\nFrom101-102:2\\n\\nFrom103-104:2\\n\\nFrom105-106:2\\n\\nFrom108:1\\n\\nTotal:91 + (2*8) +1=91+16+1=108.\\n\\nTherefore, the answer is108. However, the example given in the problem statement uses8 sevens to get875. Let\\'s see if that aligns.\\n\\nIn the example, n=8. Let\\'s see if n=8 is in our count. For n=8, which corresponds to k=(1000 -n)/9=(1000 -8)/9=992/9≈110.22. Wait, no, wait. Wait, earlier we had n=1000 -9k. So to get n=8, we need1000 -9k=8 =>9k=992 =>k=992/9≈110.22. But k must be integer, so n=8 is not possible. However, in the example, they use8 sevens to get875. But according to our problem, n is the number of 7\\'s used. In the example, n=8: the expression is7+77+777+7+7=875. So, total 7\\'s used:1+2+3+1+1=8. Therefore, n=8. So, what\\'s the corresponding k?\\n\\nWait, in our formulation, the sum of T_k\\'s must be1000. In the example, the sum is875/7=125. So, sum of T_k\\'s=125. Therefore, k=125? No, wait, T_k terms are1,11,111, etc. The example\\'s sum is7*(1 +11 +111 +1 +1)=7*(125)=875. Therefore, the sum of T_k\\'s is125. So, in our Diophantine equation, we would need a +11b +111c=125. Then, n=a +2b +3c. For the example, the decomposition is1 (T_1) +11 (T_2) +111 (T_3) +1 (T_1) +1 (T_1)=125. Therefore, a=3, b=1, c=1. So, n=3*1 +1*2 +1*3=3+2+3=8. Therefore, k=12c +b=12*1 +1=13. Then, n=1000 -9k=1000 -117=883. Wait, but in the example, n=8. This discrepancy suggests that my formulation is incorrect.\\n\\nWait, hold on. There\\'s a confusion here between the two problems. The original problem is to sum numbers made of7\\'s to get7000, which translates to summing T_k\\'s (1,11,111,...) to get1000 (since7000/7=1000). However, the example given is for875, which is not7000. So, perhaps the example is not directly relevant to the current problem.\\n\\nBut the key point is that in the example, n=8 corresponds to a sum of T_k\\'s=125, which required k=13 (from our earlier formula n=1000 -9k), but this doesn\\'t align. This suggests that my formulation might be incorrect.\\n\\nWait, no. Let\\'s re-express:\\n\\nIn the original problem, we have to reach7000 by summing numbers composed of7\\'s. Each such number is7*T_k, where T_k is1,11,111, etc. Therefore, the total sum is7*(sum of T_k\\'s)=7000 => sum of T_k\\'s=1000. Therefore, the problem reduces to expressing1000 as a sum of T_k\\'s, and finding the number of distinct n\\'s, where n is the total number of digits in the T_k\\'s, which is the sum of the lengths of each T_k. Since each T_k of length m corresponds to m 7\\'s in the original string.\\n\\nTherefore, n is equal to the sum of the lengths of the T_k\\'s used. For example, in the problem\\'s example, the sum is875=7*(1+11+111+1+1). The lengths are1,2,3,1,1, which sum to8. Therefore, n=8.\\n\\nIn our current problem, to reach7000, we need to express1000 as a sum of T_k\\'s. For each such decomposition, n is the sum of the lengths of the T_k\\'s. So, if we have a decomposition like T_1 + T_2 + T_3 + T_1 + T_1=1+11+111+1+1=125, then n=1+2+3+1+1=8. However, in our problem, the target sum of T_k\\'s is1000, not125.\\n\\nIn our formulation, we set:\\n\\na +11b +111c =1000\\n\\nand n= a +2b +3c\\n\\nwhere a,b,c are the number of T_1\\'s, T_2\\'s, and T_3\\'s. However, in reality, there could be longer T_k\\'s like T_4=1111, but we concluded they are too large. Wait, T_4=1111 which is1111>1000, so cannot be used. Therefore, only T_1, T_2, T_3 are possible.\\n\\nBut in our earlier analysis, we considered only T_1, T_2, T_3, but wait, T_3=111, T_4=1111=1111, which is1111>1000. But1000 is the target sum. Therefore, T_3=111 is allowed, but T_4=1111 is not, as1111>1000. Therefore, in the decomposition, we can only use T_1, T_2, T_3.\\n\\nBut wait, earlier we considered c as the number of T_3\\'s (111), but in the equation a +11b +111c=1000, which corresponds to using a T_1\\'s, b T_2\\'s, and c T_3\\'s. Therefore, the lengths would be a*1 + b*2 + c*3, which is n.\\n\\nTherefore, the equation is correct. However, in the example, they used T_1, T_2, T_3, etc., but in our problem, since the target is1000, we can only use up to T_3.\\n\\nBut the key is that in our current problem, n is the sum of the lengths, which is a +2b +3c.\\n\\nTherefore, in our earlier formulation, solving a +11b +111c=1000 and then n= a +2b +3c is correct.\\n\\nHowever, the earlier confusion about the example is because the example uses a different target sum (875), not1000, so it\\'s not directly applicable.\\n\\nTherefore, returning to the problem at hand, we need to find all possible n= a +2b +3c where a +11b +111c=1000, with a,b,c non-negative integers. We determined that the possible k=12c +b, and n=1000 -9k, leading to108 possible k\\'s, hence108 possible n\\'s. But this assumes that each k is unique, but we saw that k=12 can be achieved by different (c,b) pairs. However, since n=1000-9k, even if k is the same from different (c,b) pairs, n will be the same. Therefore, the number of distinct n\\'s is equal to the number of distinct k\\'s, regardless of how many ways k can be achieved.\\n\\nBut according to our detailed count, there are108 distinct k\\'s, hence108 distinct n\\'s. However, when we considered the ranges, we saw that k=107 is missing, which would correspond to n=1000 -9*107=1000-963=37. Is37 a possible n? Let\\'s check if there\\'s a decomposition with n=37.\\n\\nTo have n=37, we need a +2b +3c=37 and a +11b +111c=1000.\\n\\nSubtracting the first equation from the second:\\n\\n( a +11b +111c ) - ( a +2b +3c )=1000 -37\\n\\n9b +108c=963\\n\\nDivide both sides by9:\\n\\nb +12c=107\\n\\nTherefore, b=107 -12c\\n\\nSince b >=0, 107 -12c >=0 => c <= floor(107/12)=8 (since12*9=108>107)\\n\\nSo c=0 to8\\n\\nFor each c:\\n\\nc=0: b=107, a=37 -2*107 -3*0=37 -214= -177 <0 invalid\\n\\nc=1: b=107-12=95, a=37 -2*95 -3=37 -190 -3= -156 <0 invalid\\n\\nc=2: b=107-24=83, a=37 -166 -6= -135 <0 invalid\\n\\nc=3: b=107-36=71, a=37 -142 -9= -114 <0\\n\\nc=4: b=107-48=59, a=37 -118 -12= -93 <0\\n\\nc=5: b=107-60=47, a=37 -94 -15= -72 <0\\n\\nc=6: b=107-72=35, a=37 -70 -18= -51 <0\\n\\nc=7: b=107-84=23, a=37 -46 -21= -30 <0\\n\\nc=8: b=107-96=11, a=37 -22 -24= -9 <0\\n\\nAll possibilities result in a negative a, which is invalid. Therefore, there\\'s no solution for n=37. Hence, k=107 is not achievable, which means that our earlier count of108 k\\'s is incorrect because it assumes k=107 is covered, but it\\'s not. Therefore, the correct number of distinct k\\'s is108 -1=107.\\n\\nBut why does the earlier count say108? Because when we considered the added k\\'s, we assumed that each c from1-8 adds2 new k\\'s, and c=9 adds1. However, in reality, the maximum k from c=8 is106, and c=9 adds108. Therefore, k=107 is missing. Therefore, the total number of k\\'s is108 -1=107.\\n\\nBut how does this reconcile with the detailed count where we added17 k\\'s (from c=1-9) to the original91 from c=0, totaling108?\\n\\nThe mistake is that when we added the new k\\'s from c=1-9, we assumed that each c adds2 new k\\'s, but in reality, for c=9, we add1 k (108). However, the k=108 is beyond106, so there\\'s a gap at107. Therefore, the total k\\'s are:\\n\\nFrom c=0:0-90 (91)\\n\\nFrom c=1-8: each adds2 new k\\'s beyond the previous maximum (total8*2=16)\\n\\nFrom c=9: adds1 new k (108)\\n\\nTotal:91+16+1=108. However, the k\\'s from c=1-8 go up to106, so the k\\'s are0-106 (except107) plus108. Therefore, total numbers:\\n\\nFrom0-106:107 numbers\\n\\nMinus107 (missing)\\n\\nPlus108:1\\n\\nTotal:107 -1 +1=107.\\n\\nTherefore, the correct number of distinct k\\'s is107, hence107 distinct n\\'s.\\n\\nBut how can this be? The detailed count suggested108, but considering the gap at107, it should be107.\\n\\nThis contradiction arises from the overlap assumption. The correct answer is107, as k=107 is missing and cannot be achieved.\\n\\nTo confirm, let\\'s check if there\\'s a solution for k=107.\\n\\nk=107 corresponds to n=1000 -9*107=1000 -963=37.\\n\\nAs shown above, there\\'s no solution for n=37. Therefore, k=107 is indeed missing, reducing the total distinct k\\'s by1, leading to107.\\n\\nHowever, according to the earlier count where each c from1-8 adds2 new k\\'s and c=9 adds1, totaling108, this suggests that the initial assumption was that all k\\'s up to108 are covered except107. But in reality, the k\\'s are0-106 (107 numbers) plus108 (1 number), totaling108, but with107 missing. However, 0-106 inclusive is107 numbers, so if107 is missing, we have106 numbers there, plus108 gives107.\\n\\nBut this contradicts the count of k\\'s added by each c. The confusion comes from whether k=108 is included or not. Since k=108 is achieved by c=9, it\\'s a valid k. Therefore, the total k\\'s are0-106 (107 numbers) with107 missing, plus108, totaling107 +1=108. But0-106 includes107 numbers, but we are missing107, so it\\'s106 numbers. Then adding108 gives107.\\n\\nThis is a paradox. The resolution is that k=108 is outside the0-106 range. Therefore, the total distinct k\\'s are:\\n\\nFrom0-106:107 numbers\\n\\nMinus1 (107)\\n\\nPlus1 (108)\\n\\nTotal:107 -1 +1=107.\\n\\nTherefore, the correct number of distinct k\\'s is107, leading to107 distinct n\\'s.\\n\\nHowever, in the detailed count where we added17 k\\'s beyond c=0\\'s0-90, we have:\\n\\nFrom c=0:0-90 (91)\\n\\nFrom c=1-8: added16 k\\'s (2 per c)\\n\\nFrom c=9: added1 k (108)\\n\\nTotal:91+16+1=108.\\n\\nBut if k=107 is missing, then one of these k\\'s must not exist. However, according to the earlier per c analysis, the added k\\'s are:\\n\\nc=1:91,92\\n\\nc=2:93,94\\n\\nc=3:95,96\\n\\nc=4:97,98\\n\\nc=5:99,100\\n\\nc=6:101,102\\n\\nc=7:103,104\\n\\nc=8:105,106\\n\\nc=9:108\\n\\nSo, these are16 new k\\'s (8 pairs) plus108, totaling17. Added to the original91 gives108. But since none of these added k\\'s include107, the total is108.\\n\\nTherefore, the conclusion is that there are108 distinct k\\'s, hence108 distinct n\\'s, even though k=107 is missing. Because k=108 is included, the total count remains108.\\n\\nThe confusion arises from the overlap between the k\\'s added by each c and the original k\\'s from c=0. However, since the added k\\'s beyond c=0 are all greater than90 and do not include107, but include108, the total distinct k\\'s are indeed108.\\n\\nTherefore, the correct answer is108. However, when we tried to check for k=107, we found it\\'s not possible, but since k=108 is included, the total remains108. Therefore, the number of distinct n\\'s is108.\\n\\nBut this contradicts the example where n=8 is possible, but according to our formula, n=1000-9k, if k=125 (as in the example), then n=1000-1125=-125, which is impossible. This suggests a miscalculation.\\n\\nWait, no, in the example, they are summing to875, not7000. So in their case, the target sum of T_k\\'s is875/7=125. Therefore, k=125, and n= a +2b +3c=8. But in our problem, the target is1000. Therefore, the example is not directly applicable.\\n\\nBut the key issue is that in our problem, the equation a +11b +111c=1000 must hold, and n= a +2b +3c. We transformed this into n=1000 -9*(12c +b), which is correct. Therefore, each solution (c,b) corresponds to a unique k=12c +b, and hence a unique n=1000 -9k. Since k=12c +b, and c and b are non-negative integers with111c +11b <=1000, the k\\'s can range as we discussed.\\n\\nThe key insight is that each k from0-90, then91-92,...,108 (except107) are achievable, leading to108 distinct k\\'s. Therefore, the number of distinct n\\'s is108.\\n\\nHowever, when we checked for k=107, there was no solution, but k=108 is achievable (c=9, b=0). Therefore, the total number of distinct k\\'s is108, hence the answer is108.\\n\\nBut wait, the problem asks for the number of values of n for which it\\'s possible to insert \\'+\\' signs to get7000. If there are108 distinct n\\'s, that would be the answer. However, considering that in our earlier equation, n= a +2b +3c, and we have constraints that a,b,c are non-negative integers satisfying a +11b +111c=1000, it\\'s possible that multiple (a,b,c) triples can lead to the same n. However, our analysis using k=12c +b and n=1000 -9k showed that each k corresponds to a unique n, and each n corresponds to a unique k. Therefore, the number of distinct n\\'s is equal to the number of distinct k\\'s.\\n\\nGiven that we have108 distinct k\\'s, the answer should be108. However, this seems high. For example, n=1000 corresponds to k=0 (no terms, which is impossible), but in our formulation, k=0 corresponds to a=1000, b=0, c=0. But a=1000 means1000 T_1\\'s, which would require1000*1=1000 7\\'s. But n= a +2b +3c=1000 +0 +0=1000. So, inserting \\'+\\' signs between1000 7\\'s as all single 7\\'s:7+7+...+7 (1000 times). The sum would be7*1000=7000. Therefore, n=1000 is valid. Similarly, n=1000 -9*1=991 corresponds to k=1, which would require a=1000 -11*0 -111*0 -1=999, b=0, c=0? Wait, no. Wait, k=1 corresponds to12c +b=1. Since c and b are non-negative integers, the only solution is c=0, b=1. Therefore, a=1000 -11*1 -111*0=989. Therefore, n=989 +2*1 +3*0=991. So, this corresponds to989 T_1\\'s and1 T_2\\'s, totaling989+2=991 7\\'s. The sum would be989*7 +77=6923 +77=7000. Yes, that works. Therefore, n=991 is valid.\\n\\nSimilarly, the minimum n is when we use the largest possible terms (T_3=111). Let\\'s see, the maximum c is9 (from earlier), which gives a=1, b=0, c=9. Then n=1 +0 +27=28. Therefore, n=28. But according to our earlier formula, n=1000 -9*108=1000 -972=28. So, the minimum n is28. Therefore, n ranges from28 to1000, but not all integers in this range are possible. According to our analysis, there are108 distinct n\\'s. However, this seems too few because the range from28 to1000 is973 numbers, and108 is much less.\\n\\nBut wait, no. The key is that n=1000 -9k, where k ranges from0-90,91-92,...,108. Therefore, n starts at1000 (k=0) and decreases by9 each time k increases by1. Therefore, n takes the values1000, 991,982,..., down to28 (k=108). Therefore, the number of distinct n\\'s is108, as each k from0-108 (except107) gives a distinct n. Therefore, the answer is108.\\n\\nBut according to the earlier example, n=8 is possible for a smaller sum, but in our problem, the minimum n is28. This makes sense because to reach7000, you need at least7000/777≈9 terms of777, which would require9*3=27 7\\'s, but since777*9=6993, which is7 less than7000, you need an additional7, totaling28 7\\'s. Therefore, the minimum n is28.\\n\\nTherefore, the possible values of n are28,37,46,...,991,1000, with each differing by9. However, according to our earlier analysis, there are108 distinct n\\'s, which would correspond to the number of terms in the arithmetic sequence starting at28, ending at1000, with common difference9.\\n\\nBut let\\'s verify:\\n\\nThe first term a_1=28\\n\\nThe last term a_n=1000\\n\\nCommon difference d=9\\n\\nNumber of terms n= ((1000 -28)/9) +1= (972/9)+1=108+1=109.\\n\\nWait, but according to this, there should be109 terms. But our analysis says108. Contradiction.\\n\\nWait, if we consider the arithmetic sequence from28 to1000 with difference9:\\n\\nThe nth term is28 + (n-1)*9=1000\\n\\nSolving for n:\\n\\n(n-1)*9=972\\n\\nn-1=108\\n\\nn=109\\n\\nTherefore, there should be109 terms. However, our analysis via the Diophantine equation gave108 distinct n\\'s. The discrepancy arises because when we considered k=0-108 (109 values), but excluded k=107, leading to108 values. However, according to the arithmetic sequence, there should be109 terms. This suggests an error in our analysis.\\n\\nThe error is that when we considered k=0-108, excluding107, we have108 values. However, in the arithmetic sequence, from28 to1000 with step9, there are109 terms. Therefore, there\\'s a miscalculation somewhere.\\n\\nLet\\'s re-express:\\n\\nThe possible n\\'s are given by n=1000 -9k, where k is in the set of integers we found (0-106 except107, plus108). Total of108 k\\'s. Therefore, n\\'s are:\\n\\nFor k=0:1000\\n\\nk=1:991\\n\\n...\\n\\nk=107:1000 -963=37 (invalid, no solution)\\n\\nk=108:28\\n\\nBut since k=107 is invalid, the sequence skips37, hence the number of terms is109 -1=108.\\n\\nTherefore, the arithmetic sequence would have109 terms from k=0-108, but since k=107 is invalid, it\\'s108 terms. Therefore, the answer is108.\\n\\nBut how does this align with the arithmetic sequence count? If we remove37 from the sequence, then the number of terms is108. However, in reality, the missing term is37, but the sequence from28 to1000 with step9 includes28,37,...,1000. Therefore, if37 is missing, the total number of terms is108.\\n\\nTo confirm, let\\'s list some terms:\\n\\nFirst term:28 (k=108)\\n\\nNext:37 (k=107) - missing\\n\\nNext:46 (k=106)\\n\\n...\\n\\nLast term:1000 (k=0)\\n\\nTherefore, if37 is missing, the total number of terms is109 -1=108.\\n\\nTherefore, the correct answer is108.\\n\\nHowever, in our detailed analysis, we have108 distinct k\\'s leading to108 distinct n\\'s. This aligns with the arithmetic sequence missing one term (37), hence108 terms.\\n\\nTherefore, the answer is108. However, the problem states \"For how many values of n is it possible...\" and the answer is108. However, the initial example in the problem uses8 7\\'s, but in our problem, the minimum n is28. This suggests that the answer is108.\\n\\nBut let\\'s check with the equation:\\n\\nThe number of terms in the arithmetic sequence from28 to1000 with difference9 is floor((1000 -28)/9) +1= floor(972/9)+1=108 +1=109. However, since37 is missing, it\\'s108.\\n\\nTherefore, the answer is108.\\n\\nBut to ensure correctness, let\\'s check small cases.\\n\\nFor example, n=28: c=9, b=0, a=1. Sum=1*1 +0*11 +9*111=1 +0 +999=1000. Yes, valid.\\n\\nn=37: Not possible, as shown earlier.\\n\\nn=46: k=106: n=1000 -9*106=1000 -954=46. Check if possible.\\n\\nWe need a +11b +111c=1000 and a +2b +3c=46.\\n\\nSubtract:\\n\\n9b +108c=954 =>b +12c=106\\n\\nThus, b=106-12c\\n\\nPossible c=0-8 (since12*9=108>106)\\n\\nFor c=8: b=106-96=10, a=46 -20 -24=2. Check sum:2 +11*10 +111*8=2 +110 +888=1000. Yes, valid. So n=46 is possible.\\n\\nSimilarly, n=1000: k=0, a=1000, b=0,c=0. Sum=1000*1=1000. Yes, valid.\\n\\nn=991: k=1, a=989, b=1, c=0. Sum=989 +11*1=1000. Valid.\\n\\nn=982: k=2, a=978, b=2, c=0. Sum=978 +22=1000. Valid.\\n\\nTherefore, all n\\'s from28 to1000 in steps of9, except37, are valid. Hence, total number of terms is (1000 -28)/9 +1 -1= (972)/9 +1 -1=108 +1 -1=108.\\n\\nTherefore, the correct answer is108.', 'answer': '108'}\n",

Find the index of the 100th term for which $a_n < 0$ .', 'solution': 'Alright, let\\'s try to tackle this problem. So, we have a sequence defined by a_n = sum_{k=1}^n sin(k), where k is in radians. We need to find the index of the 100th term where a_n < 0. That means we have to find the 100th value of n such that the cumulative sum of sin(1) + sin(2) + ... + sin(n) is negative. Hmm, okay.\\n\\nFirst off, I need to recall that the sine function here is in radians. So each term sin(k) is the sine of an integer number of radians. Since sine radians oscillate between -1 and 1, depending on the angle, but these angles here are just increasing integers (1, 2, 3,... radians). So, each term sin(1), sin(2), etc., are points sampled every 1 radian along the sine curve.\\n\\nNow, summing these up: since the sine function is periodic with period 2π (~6.283 radians), every time we go past 2π, the sine values repeat. However, since here we are just adding integer radians each time, the sum is not inherently periodic. However, maybe there\\'s a way to model this cumulative sum?\\n\\nWait, summing sin(k) from k=1 to n. That\\'s a sum of terms sin(1), sin(2), ..., sin(n). I wonder if there\\'s a closed-form formula for such a sum. Let me think.\\n\\nI recall that the sum of sin terms can sometimes be expressed using trigonometric identities. Specifically, the sum of sin(kθ) from k=1 to n has a formula, which involves sin(nθ/2) / sin(θ/2) multiplied by another term. Let me verify that.\\n\\nYes, the formula for the sum of a sine series is:\\n\\nSum_{k=1}^n sin(kθ) = [sin(nθ/2) * sin((n+1)θ/2)] / sin(θ/2)\\n\\nIn this case, since each term is sin(k), here θ is 1 radian. So substituting θ = 1, the formula becomes:\\n\\nSum_{k=1}^n sin(k) = sin(n/2) * sin((n + 1)/2) / sin(1/2)\\n\\nLet me check that. Let\\'s suppose θ is 1, so yes, plugging in:\\n\\nSum = [sin(n/2) * sin((n+1)/2)] / sin(1/2)\\n\\nSo, that gives a closed-form expression for a_n. Therefore, a_n = [sin(n/2) * sin((n + 1)/2)] / sin(1/2)\\n\\nThat\\'s really helpful! Then, we can write a_n in terms of that expression.\\n\\nNow, the problem reduces to finding the 100th n such that this expression is negative. So, we need to find the 100th n where a_n < 0. Let\\'s start by analyzing when a_n is negative.\\n\\nFirst, look at the expression: [sin(n/2) * sin((n+1)/2)] / sin(1/2). Since sin(1/2) is a positive constant (sin(0.5) ≈ 0.479, positive), the denominator is positive. So, the sign of a_n is determined by the numerator: sin(n/2) * sin((n + 1)/2). Therefore, a_n is negative when sin(n/2) * sin((n +1)/2) < 0. So, the product of sin(n/2) and sin((n+1)/2) must be negative. Therefore, these two sines must have opposite signs.\\n\\nSo when does sin(n/2) * sin((n+1)/2) < 0?\\n\\nThis would happen when one of the sines is positive and the other is negative. So, the term n/2 and (n+1)/2 must be in different \"half-periods\" of the sine function. That is, crossing from positive to negative or vice versa between n/2 and (n+1)/2.\\n\\nThus the function sin(x) changes sign whenever x crosses a multiple of π. So, sin(x) is positive when x is in (0, π), negative when x is in (π, 2π), and so on periodically.\\n\\nSo, we can think of x = n/2 and x = (n +1)/2. We need to check if these two x values straddle a multiple of π. In other words, there exists integer k such that n/2 < kπ < (n +1)/2. Because then as we go from n/2 to (n +1)/2, we cross a multiple of π, thereby changing the sign. When such a crossing occurs, the product of sin(n/2) and sin((n +1)/2) would be negative. So in that case, a_n is negative.\\n\\nTherefore, the inequality a_n < 0 corresponds to the existence of an integer k such that n/2 < kπ < (n +1)/2. Or, equivalently, [n < 2kπ and n +1 > 2kπ].\\n\\nSo, solving for n, we can write the inequality as:\\n\\n2kπ -1 < n < 2kπ\\n\\nBut n must be a positive integer. So this inequality would hold if n is the integer just below 2kπ. Hmmm. So, for each k, the interval 2kπ -1 < n < 2kπ would contain exactly one integer n, which is floor(2kπ). Wait.\\n\\nWait, 2kπ is approximately, but n must be less than 2kπ. But n should be the integer just below 2kπ.\\n\\nWait. Let\\'s re-examine.\\n\\nWe have n/2 < kπ < (n +1)/2.\\n\\nMultiply both sides by 2:\\n\\nn < 2kπ < n +1.\\n\\nHence, n must be the integer that is immediately below 2kπ.\\n\\nTherefore, n = floor(2kπ - ε), where ε approaches zero. So, n = floor(2kπ). However, since 2kπ is not necessarily an integer, n would be floor(2kπ). For example, if 2kπ is 7.5, then floor(2kπ) = 7.\\n\\nThus, each crossing of 2kπ corresponds to a value of n = floor(2kπ) where a_n crosses a_n < 0.\\n\\nTherefore, for each integer k, n_k = floor(2kπ). Let me check.\\n\\nBut wait, let\\'s double-check with an example. Let k=1:\\n\\n2kπ = 2π ≈6.283. So floor(2π)=6. Then n=6.\\n\\nCheck if a_6 is indeed negative. Let me compute a_n for n=6.\\n\\nUsing the closed-form formula:\\n\\na_6 = (sin(6/2)*sin(7/2))/sin(1/2)\\n\\nSo sin(3) * sin(3.5) / sin(0.5)\\n\\nCalculate sin(3): ~0.141\\n\\nsin(3.5): ~-0.944\\n\\nMultiply: 0.141 * (-0.944) ≈ -0.133\\n\\nDivide by sin(0.5) ~0.479. So ~-0.133 / 0.479 ≈ -0.278<0. So a_6 is negative. Correct. Then for k=1, n_1=6.\\n\\nThen similarly, k=2: 2kπ=4π≈12.566. floor(4π)=12. Then n=12.\\n\\nSimilarly compute a_12: [sin(6) sin(6.5)/sin(0.5)]\\n\\nSin(6)≈0.141, sin(6.5)=sin(6.5) ≈0.739. So product≈0.141 *0.739≈0.104. Divide by sin(0.5)=≈0.479, so≈0.216. So positive? Wait, but equation suggests n=12? Wait, maybe I flipped.\\n\\nWait, maybe confusion here. Let\\'s compute.\\n\\nWait, if k=2: 2kπ=4π≈12.566. n=floor(4π)=12. Let\\'s compute a_{12}. Using the formula, sin(12/2)=sin(6)≈0.141 and sin(12.5/2)=sin(6.25)= approx sin(6.25)=sin(6π/2 + 0.25). Wait, radians: 6.25 radians. Wait, sin(6.25). Let me directly compute:\\n\\nsin(6)=as above ~ sin(6)≈0.141. sin(6.25 radians):\\n\\nSince 6 radians = roughly 6-2π=6-6.283≈-0.283. So 6 radians≈-0.283 radians (equivalent to sin(-0.283)= -sin(0.283)≈-0.283). But wait, sin(6)=sin(6 - 2π)=sin(-0.283). But actual sin(6) is just sin(6 radians)=~ sin(6) ≈0.141? Wait, I must enter 6 radians in calculator.\\n\\nWait, 1 rad≈57 degrees, so 6 radians≈342 degrees, which is equivalent to 342 - 360 = -18 degrees, sin(-18 degrees)= -sin(18)≈-0.309. Wait, so sin(6) ≈-0.309?\\n\\nWait, my previous calculation was sin(3 radians)=approx 0.141? Wait 3 radians ≈ 171 degrees, sin(171)= sin(180 -9)= approx sin(9)≈0.156. But precise computation:\\n\\nCompute sin(3):\\n\\n3 radians ≈3*57.3≈171.9 degrees. sin(3 radians)≈sin(171.9°)≈approx 0.156. Wait, but using calculator:\\n\\nsin(3) ≈0.141 radian? Wait digitally, let me check: on calculator: sin(3 radians)= sin(3)=≈0.141. Wait, that\\'s correct. So 3 radians is still in the first half-period (3 radians < π≈3.141), so yes: sin(3)≈0.141.\\n\\nSimilarly, sin(6 radians): 6 radians is over π. π≈3.141, 2π≈6.283.\\n\\nSo sin(6 radians) = sin(6 - 0.283*2π cycles? Wait, sin(6) = sin(6 radians).\\n\\nSince 6 radians is less than 2π (≈6.283), so inside the second half of the sine period. Since sin(6 - π)=sin(6 - 3.141)=sin(2.859 radians).\\n\\nWait, sin(π + x) = -sin(x). So sin(6)=sin(π + (6 - π))= sin(π + 2.859)= -sin(2.859). sin(2.859)=sin(pi - 0.282)=sin(0.282)=approx 0.282. So sin(6)= -0.282. Wait calculator sin(6): which is ≈sin(6)= sin(6 rad)= approx -0.141? Wait, hmmm, perhaps my estimation is wrong.\\n\\nMaybe to get exact calculator values.\\n\\nUsing calculator:\\n\\nsin(1)=≈0.841\\n\\nsin(2)=≈0.909\\n\\nsin(3)=≈0.141\\n\\nsin(4)=≈-0.756\\n\\nsin(5)=≈-0.958\\n\\nsin(6)=≈-0.141\\n\\nWait, sin(6)=≈-0.141? Hmm, so that\\'s an important point. So 6 radians: sin(6)=sin(6)= approx -0.141. sin((6 +1)/2=6.5/2≈3.25: sin(3.25). Let\\'s compute.\\n\\nWait, numerator of a_{12}:\\n\\nsin(12/2)= sin(6)≈-0.141; sin((12+1)/2)= sin(6.5)= Let\\'s compute sin(6.5 radians). 6.5 radians.\\n\\nAgain, 6.5 radians is greater than 2π? 2π≈6.283. 6.5 >6.283, so equivalent to sin(6.5) = sin(6.5 - 2π)≈sin(0.217 radians)≈0.217.\\n\\nWait precise value:\\n\\nsin(6.5) radians: sin(6.5)≈0.217.\\n\\nTherefore, sin(6)*sin(6.5)= (-0.141)(0.217)=≈-0.0306\\n\\nDivide by sin(0.5): sin(0.5)=≈0.479, so a_12≈-0.0306 /0.479≈-0.063, negative. So a_{12} is negative.\\n\\nWait, but in my previous step, when I thought for n=12, compute numerator sin(6)*sin(6.5). If that\\'s negative, the a_12 is negative.\\n\\nHmm, then in this: So for k=2, n=12. However, when k=2, 2kπ=4π≈12.566, floor(4π)=12. So n=12 is the one where a_n <0.\\n\\nBut when I put that for k=1, n=6, floor(2π≈6.283)=6, which gives a_6 negative, and k=2, n=12, floor(4π)≈12.566→12, and check a_12 is negative. Hence this formula n=floor(2kπ) gives the n indices where a_n is negative.\\n\\nTherefore, for each k=1,2,..., floor 2kπ gives n where a_n is negative. Hence the 100th such term will be n = floor(2*100π)≈floor(200π). But wait, hold on. Wait, going step by step.\\n\\nWait, each k=1 corresponds to one crossing at ~2π, resulting in n=6. Then k=2, next crossing at ~4π, floor(4π≈12.566=>12). Then k=3, floor(6π≈18.849⇒18). so n=18.\\n\\nSo n_k=floor(2kπ). Therefore, each k=1 to 100, corresponds to n= floor(2kpi). But in order to get the 100th term for which a_n<0, we need the 100th k, that is, n=floor(2*100π). Wait that can\\'t be. Because 2kπ for k=100: 200π≈628.318. So floor(200π)=628. So n=628? Then is that the 100th term where a_n<0? Hmm. Wait, but let\\'s examine step by step.\\n\\nWait, perhaps for each natural number k, 2kπ is a value where there is a sign crossing. Therefore, the nth term where it\\'s negative is when floor(2kπ). So to get the convergence, the instances where a_n is negative are the intervals where n is floor(2kπ).\\n\\nBut that\\'s perhaps leading us thinking each k gives 1 n?, so k gives n ≈2kπ but less, each k corresponds to one n.\\n\\nBut wait step through the first few:\\n\\nk=1: floor(2π≈6.283)=6: a6 negative (checked))\\n\\nk=2: floor(4π≈12.566)=12: a12 is negative (checked)\\n\\nk=3: floor(6π≈18.849)=18: would a_18 be negative?\\n\\nLet me verify a_18.\\n\\nSumming up to n=18. Using closed formula:\\n\\nsin(n/2)= sin(9)≈0.141; sin((n+1)/2= sin(19/2)= sin(9.5)\\n\\nsin(9.5 radians). How?\\n\\n9.5 radians: subtract 3*pi radians (3π≈9.424). So sin(9.5)= sin(9.5 - 3π)= sin(9.5 -9.424)= sin(0.076 radians)=≈0.076.\\n\\nThen, sin(9)≈0.141 (as sin(9 radians= over 2π*4= ~8pi? Wait, subtract multiple pi over.\\n\\nWait, sin(9 radians) is equivalent to sin(9 - 2π*1)=sin(9 -6.283)= sin(2.717 radians≈155 degrees). sin(2.717)≈approx positive. Wait. So more accurately:\\n\\nIf sin(9 radians), 9 radians is 9/(2π)≈1.430 cycles. 9 radians≈ sin(9). Let\\'s get exact value:\\n\\nCompute sin(9): radians:\\n\\nSince 2π≈6.283: 9 radians=6.283 + 2.717, so sin(9)=sin(2π+2.717)=sin(2.717). And sin(2.717 radians=approximate to sin(2.717), but in 2.717 radians≈155 degrees. So sine is positive? Wait 2.717 radians is less than π? Wait π≈3.14. No, 2.717 is less than 3.14. Wait 2π radians? 2.717 is in the interval pi/2 < but less than pi? Wait:\\n\\nWait 2.717 radians is approximately:\\n\\npi=3.141, so 2.717 is pi - 0.424 radians. So sin(2.717)=sin(pi -0.424)=sin(0.424)= approx 0.414. Wait reflection formula: sin(pi -x)=sin(x).\\n\\nWait, yes, sin(pi -x)=sin(x). So sin(2.717)=sin(pi -0.424)=sin(0.424)=≈0.414 approx. So sin(9 radians)= sin(2.717)=≈0.414. Then sin(9.5 radians):\\n\\nSimilarly, 9.5 radians=2π*1 + 3.217 radian. So sin(3.217)=sin(pi +0.075=3.141+0.075). So sin(pi +0.075)= -sin(0.075≈ -0.075.\\n\\nTherefore, sin(9)/v=0.414, sin(9.5)= -0.075. Product=0.414*-0.075≈-0.031.\\n\\nDivide by sin(0.5)≈0.479: approx -0.031/0.479≈-0.065. Therefore a_18≈-0.065<0. Correct.\\n\\nSo, so it seems each k=1 to... gives n=floor(2kπ), and the 100th term would be floor(2*100*π)=floor(200π). Because:\\n\\nn_k= floor(2kπ). Therefore, index that corresponds to k=100 is n=floor(200π). So compute 200π≈628.318. Floor to 628. Hence the index n=628. Therefore the 100th term is 628.\\n\\nBut is this true? Wait, hang on, this approach is assuming that each k=1,2,...,100 gives one n=floor(2kπ), hence 100 terms. But for these floor values need not necessarily each correspond floored adjacent; but although 2kπ and 2(k+1)π have floors that are spaced apart, but perhaps we have floor 2kpi each time a new crossing.\\n\\nBut for example,\\n\\nk=1: 2*1*pi≈6.2838 floor 6\\n\\nk=2: 2*2* pi≈12.566 floor12\\n\\nk=3≈18.849 floor18,\\n\\nk=4≈25.132 floor25,\\n\\nup to k=100≈628.318 floor628.\\n\\nEach of these floor(2kπ) is twoπ k step, but the n_k terms are distances from 2π, each k counts for one crossing somewhere when passing multiples of 2π.\\n\\nBut let\\'s check whether these floor(2kpi) terms are increasing. Suppose floor(2kpi) for each k is an integer. Each of k=1 =>6, k=2=>12,..., k=100=>628. These n_s are all unique and each contributes one negative a_n. Therefore, n= floor(2kpi)= floor(approx 6.283, 12.566, 18.849,..., 628.318)\\n\\nHowever, notable that 2kpi increments for each k steps by roughly 6.28, each n increments 6. Now, for n=floor(2kpi). Thus, each creates unique n.\\n\\nBut need to check whether between k=1 and k=2, there are no other terms where a_n<0.\\n\\nWait earlier computations show that n=6: first negative term, then the next negative term at n=12. Then 18? How? Let me check terms between n=6 and n=12.\\n\\nWhat about n=7,8,...,11. Let\\'s check a_7\\n\\nUse closed-form formula:\\n\\na_7= sin(3.5)*sin(4)/divided by sin0.5.\\n\\nsin(3.5~3.5 radians: since pi≈3.141. sin(3.5, which is 3.141+0.359≈approx). Therefore sin(3.5)= sin(π+0.359)= -sin(0.359≈ approx -0.353\\n\\nsin(4 radians= sin(4)=> 4 radians is over pi, so sin(ice in 4 radians: subtract 2pi=4-2pi≈4-6.283≈-2.283, but sine is periodic so sin(4)≈sin(-2.283)= -sin(2.283). sin(2.283)= sin(pi -0.858)= sin(0.858)=approx0.758.\\n\\nSo sin(4)= -0.758). Thus, sin(3.5)*sin(4)= (-0.353)*(-0.758=≈0.267). Divided by sin(0.5≈0.479: 0.267/0.479≈0.557>0. So a_7 is positive.\\n\\nSimilarly check a_8:\\n\\n[sin(4)*sin(4.5)]/sin(0.5)\\n\\nsin(4)≈-0.758, sin(4.5 radians: approximates π +1.359. sin(4.5)= -sin(1.359). sin(1.359)= approx around 0.914. Then sin(4.5)= -0.914. Then product: (-0.758)*(-0.914≈0.694). Divided by 0.479≈0.694/0.479≈1.447>0. So a8 is positive.\\n\\nThen onward:\\n\\na9= sin(9/2=4.5)*sin(10/2=5). sin(4.5≈-0.914, sin(5 radians)= sin(5)≈-0.958. Product: (-0.914)*(-0.958≈0.875. 0.875/0.479≈1.827>0. Thus a9 positive.\\n\\na10= sin(5)*sin(5.5)/sin0.5. sin(5)≈-0.958; sin(5.5 radians). 5.5 radians= π+approx 2.2    radians. sin(5.5)= -sin(pi+5.5 - pi is radians). Wait, sin(5.5 - 2π=5.5 -6.283≈-0.783≈ equivalent to sin(-0.783)=~-0.700). So sin(5.5)=~-0.700. product= (-0.958)*(-0.700≈0.670. /0.479≈1.399>0. Positive.\\n\\na11= sin(11/2=5.5)*sin(12/2=6). Sin(5.5≈-0.700, sin6≈-0.141. Product=(-0.700)*(-0.141≈0.098. 0.098 /0.479≈0.205>0. Positive.\\n\\na12: already checked gives negative. So between n=6 and 12, only a12 is the next negative term. Thus each crossing multiple of 2pi gives one negative term. So perhaps each k corresponds to one n where a_n < 0.\\n\\nTherefore, if that holds, the 100th term is at k=100, floor(200PI)=628.\\n\\nSo likely the answer is 628.\\n\\nBut wait, double-check. Wait, floor(2kpi) for k=100 is floor(200 pi), floor(628.318)=628. So n=628. But need to make sure that indeed all k=1 to 100 each correspond to one negative term, and no other terms inbetween.\\n\\nFrom the initial terms (n=6,12,18,25??,Hmm Wait, wait when k increases, 2k pi isn\\'t exactly a definite integer, so the floor could be unique. However something at the 25 term?\\n\\nk=4; 4*2pi≈25.132 floor=25. Then check a25.\\n\\nYes, a25= sin(25/2=12.5) sin(26/2=13)/ sin0.5.\\n\\nsin(12.5 radians)~? Sin(12.5-2pi*3)=12.5-18.849≈-6.349 radians. sin(-6.349)= same as sin(-6.349 +2π *1= subtract +6.283→ sin(≈-0.066)≈-0.066.\\n\\nsin(13 radians= on the same measure. Sin13≈ sin(13-4π≈13 -12.566≈0.434≈sin0.434≈0.425).\\n\\nProduct= (-0.066)*(0.425≈-0.028~≈*. Divide by sin0.5≈~0.479 gives≈-0.059. So a25 is negative.\\n\\nWait which follow n=25 being negative. It seems each floor(2k pi) is unique.\\n\\nBut in kpi step: the progression steps by 6.283 radians, each floor(2k pi) is roughly spacing 6 terms, but as they differing in decimals ? does every k=floor(2kpi) contribute one unique n?\\n\\nAlternative concern: perhaps within the first 6 terms, after the first crossing in n=6, then  see here:\\n\\nAre there multiple n\\'s with negative a_n per sdf Few:steps.\\n\\nBut check from n=6 to 12, none negative except at 6 and 12. Similarly 12->18: check a17, a18. Do other terms in between hav a_n <0?\\n\\nTake a17:\\n\\nFormula: sin(17/2=8.5 rad)* sin(18/2=9 rad)/ sin0.5\\n\\nSin8.5 radians≈ sin8.5.

Hmmm Hmm none.\\n\\n Indeed, one k=1,, each n= floor(2k pi) gives only one negative term. Thus If you have k=1 to 100, then answer is n= floor(200 pi)=628. Hence Answer 628, checked the terms. Suspecting 628. But I need to verify via other approach.\\n\\nAlternatively think of cumulative sum:\\n\\nSum_{k=1}^n sin(k) can you show the sum oscillates and crosses zero periodically at these points?\\n\\nAlternatively it\\'s possible to think of it as a wave that crosses zero near every 2kpi, with the cumulative sum?\\n\\nBut floor(2k pi) equates to truncating so yields the integer just below 2kpi.\\n\\nHence needed 10th time where floor(2k pi)=n=a_n <0.\\n\\nAlternatively maybe instead of k here index translates to each crossing.

Continuing, each n accumulates contrib.\\n\\nSo the 100th should be 2*100*pi=floor(n)=200pi≈628.\\n\\n So the answer\\'s 628 ?\\n\\nBut should also part-independent check.\\n\\nAlternatively, suppose building a recurrence relation:\\n\\nThe sum a_{n +1} = a_n + sin(n + 1). So sin(k) terms each increasing.\\n\\nSince the sequence is cumulative with a step of sin(k), which adds a sinusoidal term. Because the sin(k) steps alternate over being positive and negative through differentes, but because their step\\'s add over time, when crosses cumulative zero points.\\n\\nBut the exact points where a_n is negative are given by elements where n=floor(2kpi)\\n\\nSo over crossings of the integers when pass multiples of 2kpi (floor):\\n\\nHence general, so the answer is floor(2pi*100)=floor(200pi)=628.\\n\\nSince 200 pi≈628.318, then Floor to 628. Hence a_628 <0, and it\\'s the 100th such term where a_n is negative. So the answer is 628.\\n\\nHence, must it be 628?\\n\\nAnother perspective:\\n\\nLet’s define the 100th term for which a_n <0 corresponds to b=the 100th crossing of the Cumulative sum n=1{sin(k)}.\\n\\nAssuming Each such crossing occurs near of course each multiples of 2pi\\n\\nIntoned one crossing per ->floor(2 pi k)=n.\\n\\nTherefore the index corresponds to k*floor(2 pi points).\\n\\nHence for the 100element-> k=100．floor(200 pi)=628.\\n\\nSince c。floor(200 pi)=628．Therefore index=628.\\n\\n\\nTherefore, solution:\\n\\n\\\\boxed{628}', 'answer': '628'}\n",
      "{'question': 'Consider the parallelogram with vertices $(10,45),$ $(10,114),$ $(28,153),$ and $(28,84).$ A line through the origin cuts this figure into two congruent polygons.  The slope of the line is $m/n,$ where $m_{}$ and $n_{}$ are relatively prime positive integers.  Find $m+n.$', 'solution': \"Alright, so I have this geometry problem here about a parallelogram with four given vertices. The problem is asking for a line through the origin that splits this parallelogram into two congruent polygons, and then to find the slope of that line expressed as a reduced fraction m/n, and finally compute m + n. Hmm, okay, let's try to break this step by step.\\n\\nFirst, I need to picture the parallelogram. Parallelograms have opposite sides equal and parallel, so I can use that property. The given vertices are (10,45), (10,114), (28,153), and (28,84). Wait, hold on, so two of the points have an x-coordinate of 10, and the other two have 28. Similarly, the y-coordinates vary.\\n\\nLet me plot these points mentally: (10,45), (10,114) – these are vertical points since their x-coordinates are the same. Similarly, (28,153) and (28,84) are also on the vertical lines x = 28. Now, connecting these, it's a parallelogram. So the sides are between x=10 and x=28, all right.\\n\\nMaybe it would help to sketch or at least mentally visualize the parallelogram. The points (10,45) and (10,114) are on the left side, 69 units apart because 114 - 45 is 69. Similarly, on the right side, (28,84) and (28,153) are also 69 units apart. So, yeah, that fits the definition of a parallelogram since opposing sides are equal in length.\\n\\nNow, since it's a parallelogram, the opposite sides are also parallel. Since the left and right sides are vertical, does that mean the top and bottom sides are horizontal? Wait, no. Wait, parallelograms can have sides at any angle, not necessarily horizontal or vertical unless specified. But in this case, wait, sides between x=10 and x=28. But I think in this case, the sides might not be horizontal.\\n\\nLet me figure that out.\\n\\nWait, so (10,45) connects to (28,84). Let me compute the slope of that line. The slope would be (84 - 45)/(28 - 10) = 39/18 = 13/6. Similarly, from (10,114) to (28,153): slope is (153 - 114)/(28 - 10) = 39/18 = 13/6. So yes, the non-vertical sides both have a slope of 13/6. So that means the parallelogram is kind of leaning with that slope but also having vertical sides on x=10 and x=28.\\n\\nWait, so perhaps it's a rhombus, but only if all sides are equal. The vertical sides have length 69 (from 45 to 114, and 84 to 153). The slant sides connect (10,45) to (28,84). Let me compute that distance. Using the distance formula: sqrt((28-10)^2 + (84-45)^2) = sqrt(18^2 + 39^2) = sqrt(324 + 1521) = sqrt(1845). Wait, 1845 is 9*205, which is 9*5*41. So not a perfect square. So the slant sides are sqrt(1845) each, while the vertical sides are 69 each. So not a rhombus, just a regular parallelogram.\\n\\nWait, but if opposite sides are equal and the slopes of the non-vertical sides are equal, it must be a parallelogram. So yeah, sure. Cool.\\n\\nNow, the problem is that a line through the origin divides this parallelogram into two congruent polygons. So the line has to pass through the origin, (0,0), and somewhere through the figure, cutting it in half with both parts congruent.\\n\\nGiven that, I need to figure out what line through the origin does that. Since it's a parallelogram, which is centrally symmetric, the center of the parallelogram is the midpoint between any pair of opposite vertices. So if I take two opposite vertices, say (10,45) and (28,153), their midpoint is ((10+28)/2, (45+153)/2) = (38/2, 198/2) = (19,99). Similarly, the other pair of opposite vertices (10,114) and (28,84): midpoint is ((10+28)/2, (114 + 84)/2) = (19,99). So the center of the parallelogram is (19,99).\\n\\nSince the line has to go through the origin, (0,0), and also needs to pass through the center to split the figure into two congruent parts. Because in a parallelogram, the center is the intersection point of the diagonals, and any line through the center should divide it into two congruent figures.\\n\\nWait, but is that true? Actually, in a parallelogram, the diagonals bisect each other, so splitting it with a diagonal is one way, but as for any line through the center, yes, but only if it also passes through vertices or something? Wait, but in a parallelogram, since it's convex, any line through the center will split it into two congruent figures only if it's a line of symmetry? But a general parallelogram doesn't have reflection symmetry unless it's a rhombus or rectangle.\\n\\nBut wait, is the problem saying it's a general parallelogram? So, perhaps, the only line through the origin that can split it into two congruent parts must pass through the center, since that would allow each half to have equal area.\\n\\nBut is there more to it than that? Because depending on how the line is drawn through the center, maybe it won't necessarily result in congruent figures unless it's in a specific orientation.\\n\\nWait, but given that the problem is stating a line through the origin that splits it into two congruent polygons, which suggests that such a line exists and is unique? Or perhaps not unique? Hmm. I may need to think more.\\n\\nSo, if I have the line going through the origin and must also pass through the center of the parallelogram at (19,99). Then the slope would be 99/19, which reduces to, let me check: 99 divided by 3 is 33, 19 divided by – wait, 19 is a prime number. 99 and 19 share no common factors apart from 1, so 99/19 is already in lowest terms.\\n\\nTherefore, the slope is 99/19, so m is 99, n is 19, m + n is 118. So is that the answer? Wait, just verify.\\n\\nHold on, but let's step back. The problem says a line through the origin divides the parallelogram into two congruent polygons. So without necessarily thinking about the center, maybe there's another way.\\n\\nBut, wait, it's about congruent polygons, not just equal areas. So just splitting into equal areas is insufficient—it must be congruent, so the shape must mirror each other perfectly.\\n\\nIn that case, the only possible line would be a line of symmetry of the parallelogram. But as mentioned earlier, a general parallelogram is only symmetric under translation and rotation? Wait, hold on, no. No, translation isn't a symmetry, but a affine transformation.\\n\\nWait, actually, no. If a parallelogram is not a rectangle, rhombus, or square, it doesn't have reflection symmetry. So that would imply that the only line that can split it into two congruent figures through a point is its center. So the line that goes through the center and is a line of reflection.\\n\\nBut if that line is not one of the usual lines in the figure, but perhaps a different slope... Hmm, maybe the line through the center and the origin is the unique such line.\\n\\nWait, unless two congruent parts can be achieved through rotational symmetry. Parallelogram definitely has rotational symmetry of order 2, meaning if you rotate it 180 degrees around the center, it maps to itself.\\n\\nSo, if the line through origin and center is just producing two parts that are 180-rotations about the center, meaning congruent. So yes, that line would split the parallelogram into two congruent figures.\\n\\nAlternatively, if the line is such that it's a reflection symmetry's mirror line, but as above, only for rectangles, rhombuses, etc.\\n\\nBut in this case, since origin is outside the parallelogram (since all the vertices are positive x and y, so origin is southwest of the figure). So cutting it with a line from origin to somewhere on the figure would have to pass through the center to keep the areas congruent. So.\\n\\nAlternatively, let's use coordinates to find if they are right.\\n\\nLet me try to think step by step.\\n\\nFirstly, I can represent the parallelogram as a set of inequalities or equations.\\n\\nSince the sides are vertical at x=10 and x=28, as the left and right sides.\\n\\nThen, the top and bottom sides have slope 13/6, as we computed.\\n\\nSo, the equations of the boundaries: the left side is x=10, y from 45 to 114; the right side is x=28, y from 84 to 153.\\n\\nThe top side goes from (10,114) to (28,153) with slope 13/6, so equation is y = (13/6)(x - 10) + 114.\\n\\nSimilarly, the bottom side from (10,45) to (28,84) is y = (13/6)(x - 10) + 45.\\n\\nSo writing these equations:\\n\\nTop: y = (13/6)x + 114 - (130/6). Let me compute 114 - (130/6). 114 is 684/6, so 684/6 - 130/6 = 554/6 = 277/3 ≈ 92.333. Wait, but hang on: the top equation.\\n\\nWait, wait, that seems a bit not obvious. Let's compute:\\n\\nStarting from point (10,114), slope 13/6:\\n\\ny - 114 = (13/6)(x - 10)\\n\\nSo, y = (13/6)(x - 10) + 114\\n\\nSimilarly, the bottom side from (10,45): y = (13/6)(x - 10) + 45.\\n\\nSo, top: y = (13/6)x - 130/6 + 114\\n\\n= (13/6)x - 21.666... + 114\\n\\n= (13/6)x + 92.333...\\n\\nSimilarly, bottom: y = (13/6)x - 21.666... + 45\\n\\n= (13/6)x + 23.333...\\n\\nSo verifying, at x=28:\\n\\nTop side: (13/6)(28) + 92.333...\\n\\n(13/6)*28= (13*28)/6 = 364/6 ≈ 60.666..., plus ~92.333 is 153. Correct.\\n\\nSimilarly, bottom side: (13/6)*28 + 23.333... = 364/6 + 23.333... ≈ 60.666... + 23.333... = 84. Correct.\\n\\nSo that's good.\\n\\nNow, the other edges: vertical at x=10 from y=45 to 114, x=28 from y=84 to 153.\\n\\nSo, the figure in coordinates is that set of points bounded by x=10, x=28, and the two slant sides.\\n\\nNow, we need a line through origin, so y = kx, that will cut this figure into two congruent parts.\\n\\nNow, the thought is: because the figure is a parallelogram with center at (19,99), so would the line through origin and (19,99) be the desired line? Because that line ensures that each part is a reflection or rotation of the other.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe it isn't; perhaps it's another line through origin that still intersects the parallelogram such that the areas are equal but also congruent.\\n\\nBut to answer this, rather than assuming, maybe I should set up the problem more formally.\\n\\nFirst, perhaps I can parameterize the line through the origin as y = kx, and find the value of k such that it divides the parallelogram into two regions of equal area, and even better, congruent shapes.\\n\\nGiven the complexities, maybe integrating or figuring out the intersection points would be useful.\\n\\nAlternatively, perhaps think in terms of symmetry.\\n\\nWait, another idea: If the parallelogram has an origin outside, which it is (since all x and y coordinates are positive, so origin is at (0,0)), a line from the origin cutting the parallelogram into two congruent regions.\\n\\nGiven the center is at (19,99), the concept that any line passing through both the origin and the center will split it into two equal areas, but may not necessarily ensure that both regions are congruent.\\n\\nHowever, in the case of a parallelogram which is symmetric about the center, cutting through the center may indeed produce congruent parts. Because each half would be a mirror image with respect to the center.\\n\\nWait, actually, for the origin located outside, the line needs not be through the center necessarily. Hmm, but perhaps the line through the center is the only one that divides it into two congruent parts.\\n\\nAlternatively, perhaps the desired line is a symmetry line passing through the origin. However, considering the coordinates, I don't see any inherent symmetry with the origin unless the origin is somehow an axis of symmetry, which it isn't in this case.\\n\\nWait, perhaps we can think in terms of affine transformations.\\n\\nWait, another approach: It's known that any line through the centroid of a figure divides it into two regions of equal area. But congruent is a stronger condition, so we need more than just equal area.\\n\\nSo, while any line passing through the centroid (which, for a parallelogram, is its center (19,99)) will split it into two equal areas, so line through origin doesn’t have to pass through center but essentially must if it's going to create congruent regions.\\n\\nWait, the key is that the regions must not just have equal area but be congruent, meaning exact mirror images.\\n\\nThus, reflecting one half across the line gives the other half.\\n\\nGiven the parallelogram is a symmetric figure but the origin is outside, the question is: if we cut the parallelogram with a line through the origin which also passes through the center, so (0,0) to (19,99), whether this reflection would be exact.\\n\\nBut as per the problem statement, it is.\\n\\nAlternatively, perhaps Yes, because the center is a point of symmetry, so that the part from the line through the origin towards each half is symmetric across the center. So yes, that line will divide the parallelogram into two congruent figures.\\n\\nTherefore, if the line passes through(0,0) and (19,99), then that should be the line which is desired.\\n\\nTherefore, the slope is 99/19. Now, 99 and 19, do they share any common factors? 19 is a prime number, 99 is 9*11, so no, so 99/19 is already in simplest terms.\\n\\nTherefore, the slope m/n is 99/19, so m +n is 99 +19=118.\\n\\nTherefore, the answer is \\\\boxed{118}.\\n\\nWait a moment, is that correct? Wait, I need to consider perhaps that the line from origin to the center passes through the parallelogram and that indeed it does split it into two congruent halves. But should the line pass through the origin and center? Is that the only way to divide it into congruent figures?\\n\\nAlternatively, perhaps if we think parallelogram has certain properties.\\n\\nWait, what if the line is not passing through the center? Then perhaps one half would be translated version and couldn't be congruent.\\n\\nBut in this case, I might have convinced my self, the line must pass through the center.\\n\\nAlternatively, another thought: Because the origin is outside the parallelogram, the line passes through the origin, which then must pass through the center just in case; otherwise, the origin isn’t in the line with some other points on the parallelogram.\\n\\nBut actually, even without the line passing through the center, you can have a line passing through the origin cutting the figure if the figure is star-shaped with respect to that line? Hmm may be overcomplicating.\\n\\nBut in any case, the above earlier thought that the only way to split the figure into two congruent parts which after a rotation or reflection, the two parts must coincide.\\n\\nGiven that, lines that go through the center are the only lines that have such a property because center is a point of symmetry.\\n\\nTherefore, the line must pass through the center.\\n\\nThus, the line with slope 99/19. 99 and 19 have GCD of 19*5=95? Wait, 90 is multiple of 19 – wait, no, 19*5=95, 19*6=114, 19*10=190, 19*10 is more than 99.\\n\\nSo 19 doesn't divide into 99 evenly, it's 5.21 approximately. So yeah, 99/19 is already reduced.\\n\\nTherefore, the slope is 99/19, sum is 118, so I think that is the answer.\\n\\nFinal Answer:\\n\\\\boxed{118}\", 'answer': '118'}\n",
